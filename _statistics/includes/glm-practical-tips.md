\notes{When working with generalised linear models in practice, there are several key considerations that can significantly impact model performance:

Feature engineering is often the most critical factor in model success:

- Build modular data processing pipelines that allow you to easily test different feature sets. For example, if modeling house prices, you might want to test combinations of raw features (square footage, bedrooms), derived features (price per square foot), and interaction terms (bedrooms Ã— bathrooms).
- Consider non-linear transformations of continuous variables. For instance, taking the log of price data often helps normalize distributions.
- Be thoughtful about encoding categorical variables - one-hot encoding isn't always optimal. For high-cardinality categories, consider target encoding or feature hashing.
- Scale features appropriately - standardization or min-max scaling depending on your model assumptions.
- Document your feature creation process thoroughly, including the rationale for each transformation.

Model validation requires careful consideration:

- Cross-validation should match your real-world use case. For time series data, use time-based splits rather than random splits.
- Bootstrap sampling helps understand parameter uncertainty. For example, bootstrapping can show if a coefficient's sign might flip under different samples.
- Hold-out test sets should be truly independent. In a customer churn model, this might mean testing on future customers rather than a random subset.
- Watch for data leakage, especially with time-dependent features. If predicting customer churn, using future purchase data would create leakage.

Diagnostic checks are essential for model reliability:

- Create residual plots against fitted values and each predictor. Look for systematic patterns - a U-shaped residual plot suggests missing quadratic terms.
- For logistic regression, plot predicted probabilities against actual outcomes in bins to check calibration.
- Calculate influence measures like Cook's distance to identify outliers. In a house price model, a mansion might have outsized influence on coefficients.
- Check Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for multicollinearity. High VIF (>5-10) suggests problematic correlation between predictors.

Visualization remains crucial throughout:

- Before modeling, create scatter plots, box plots, and histograms to understand your data distribution and relationships.
- Use pairs plots to identify correlations and potential interactions between features.
- Create residual diagnostic plots including Q-Q plots for normality checking.
- When communicating results, focus on interpretable visualizations. For instance, partial dependence plots can show how predictions change with a single feature.

Additional practical considerations:

- Start simple and add complexity incrementally. A basic linear model often provides a good baseline.
- Keep track of model performance metrics across iterations to ensure changes actually improve results.
- Consider the computational cost of feature engineering - some transformations might not be feasible in production.
- Think about how features will be available in production. If a feature requires complex processing or external data, it might not be practical.
- For categorical variables with many levels, consider grouping rare categories.
- When dealing with missing data, document your imputation strategy and test its impact on model performance.}
