\subsection{Learning Generalised Linear Models}

\notes{Fitting the GLM models described above to data implies learning the parameters $\beta$ of the linear predictor. We will do so by finding the maximum likelihood estimate. By specifying the distribution of the response variable, we have in effect specified a likelihood of each individual data-point. To reach the joint likelihood of each response variable, we will make the assumption that each observed response is conditionally independent given the parameters and the explanatory variables. This leads to the following objective function,}

$$ \hat{\beta} = \arg \max_{\beta} \prod_{i=1}^{N} p(y_i | x_i, \beta). $$

\notes{GLM models are very well studied in the literature, and many different highly efficient approaches exist for fitting the parameters to data. While this is an interesting topic in itself, it is beyond the scope of this course. Instead, we will put our trust in the very well-documented library [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org) rather than implementing this ourselves. Below, the code for implementing two separate GLM models is shown. The data is count data, and the most suitable model would be a Poisson regression model for this type. In addition, we also include a standard Gaussian linear model with a single parameter parametrising the slope of the line. The output figure will show the output of fitting a Poisson regression model in red and the Gaussian model in cyan. The dotted lines shows the 95% confidence interval for the **parameters** of the fit. We should see the fit is (not surprisingly) much worse for the Gaussian model compared to the Poisson.}

\notes{The important part of the code above is the `m_poisson = sm.GLM(y,x, family=sm.families.Poisson())` call where we specify the distribution of the of the response variable. Statsmodels currently implements the following distributions, Binomial, Gamma, Gaussian, InverseGaussian, NegativeBinomial, Poisson, Tweedie which should give you a rich playground of models to work with.}
