\subsection{Building Trustworthy AI Systems}

\slides{
* Separate infrastructure concerns from domain expertise
* Design for interpretability and explainability
* Establish robust governance and oversight
}

\notes{The future of AI in critical industries depends on building systems that are not just accurate, but trustworthy. This means separating concerns appropriately—ensuring that security and reliability experts handle infrastructure while domain experts focus on the science. It means designing systems that can explain their decisions. And it means establishing governance frameworks that ensure AI serves human purposes rather than replacing human judgment.}
