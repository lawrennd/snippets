\subsection{ai@cam}

\notes{The ai@cam vision is being achieved in a manner that is modelled on other grass roots initiatives like Data Science Africa. Through leveraging the University’s vibrant interdisciplinary research community. ai@cam has formed partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected communities that embed equity and inclusion. It is developing new platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It is delivering innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students, researchers, and professionals. It is building strong connections between the University and national AI priorities.}

\notes{The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation and steward of those innovations.}

\notes{We are working across the University to empower the diversity of expertise and capability we have to focus on these broad societal problems. In April 2022 we shared an ai@cam with a vision document that outlines these challenges for the University.}

\notes{The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation and steward of those innovations.}

\notes{AI is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to deliver societal benefit and mitigate social harm.}

\notes{The initiative was funded in November 2022 where a £5M investment from the University.}

\notes{The progress made so far has been across the University community. We have successfully engaged with over members spanning more than 30 departments and institutes, bringing together academics, researchers, start-ups, and large businesses to collaborate on AI initiatives. The program has already supported 6 new funding bids and launched five interdisciplinary A-Ideas projects that bring together diverse expertise to tackle complex challenges. The establishment of the Policy Lab has created a crucial bridge between research and policy-making. Additionally, through the Pioneer program, we have initiated 46 computing projects that are helping to build our technical infrastructure and capabilities.}

\subsection{1. Bridging Macro and Micro Levels}

\notes{**Challenge**: There is often a disconnect between high-level AI research and real-world needs that must be addressed.

The A-Ideas Initiative represents an effort to bridge this gap by funding interdisciplinary projects that span 19 departments across 6 schools. This ensures diverse perspectives are brought to bear on pressing challenges. Projects focusing on climate change, mental health, and language equity demonstrate how macro-level AI capabilities can be effectively applied to micro-level societal needs.}


\notes{**Challenge**: Academic insights often fail to translate into actionable policy changes.

The Policy Lab initiative addresses this by creating direct connections between researchers, policymakers, and the public, ensuring academic insights can influence policy decisions. The Lab produces accessible policy briefs and facilitates public dialogues. A key example is the collaboration with the Bennett Institute and Minderoo Centre, which resulted in comprehensive policy recommendations for AI governance.}

\subsection{2. Addressing Data, Compute, and Capability Gaps}

\notes{**Challenge**: Organizations struggle to balance data accessibility with security and privacy concerns.

The data intermediaries initiative establishes trusted entities that represent the interests of data originators, helping to establish secure and ethical frameworks for data sharing and use. Alongside approaches for protecting data we need to improve our approach to processing data. Careful assessment of data quality and organizational data maturity ensures that data can be shared and used effectively. Together these approaches help to ensure that data can be used to serve science, citizens and society.}


\subsection{2. Addressing data, Compute and Capability Gaps}

\notes{**Challenge**: Many researchers lack access to necessary computational resources for modern research.

The HPC Pioneer Project addresses this by providing access to the Dawn supercomputer, enabling 46 diverse projects across 20 departments to conduct advanced computational research. This democratization of computing resources ensures that researchers from various disciplines can leverage high-performance computing for their work. The ai@cam project also supports the ICAIN initiative, further strengthening the computational infrastructure available to researchers with a particular focus on emerging economies.}

\newslide{2. Capability gaps contd ...}

\notes{**Challenge**: There is a significant skills gap in applying AI across different academic disciplines.

The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery addresses this through a comprehensive approach to building AI capabilities. Through a tiered training system that ranges from basic to advanced levels, the programme ensures that domain experts can develop the AI skills relevant to their field. The initiative particularly emphasizes peer-to-peer learning creating sustainable communities of practice where researchers can share knowledge and experiences through "AI Clubs".}

\subsection{3. Stakeholder Engagement and Feedback Mechanisms}

\notes{**Challenge**: AI development often proceeds without adequate incorporation of public perspectives and concerns.

Our public dialogue work, conducted in collaboration with the Kavli Centre for Ethics, Science, and the Public, creates structured spaces for public dialogue about AI's potential benefits and risks. The approach ensures that diverse voices and perspectives are heard and considered in AI development.}

\notes{**Challenge**: AI initiatives often fail to align with diverse academic needs across institutions.

Cross-University Workshops serve as vital platforms for alignment, bringing together faculty and staff from different departments to discuss AI teaching and learning strategies. By engaging professional services staff, the initiative ensures that capability building extends beyond academic departments to support staff who play key roles in implementing and maintaining AI systems.}

\subsection{4. Flexible and Adaptable Approaches}

\notes{**Challenge**: Traditional rigid, top-down research agendas often fail to address real needs effectively.

The AI-deas Challenge Development program empowers researchers to identify and propose challenge areas based on their expertise and understanding of field needs. Through collaborative workshops, these initial ideas are refined and developed, ensuring that research directions emerge organically from the academic community while maintaining alignment with broader strategic goals.}

\subsection{5. Phased Implementation and Realistic Planning}

\notes{**Challenge**: Ambitious AI initiatives often fail due to unrealistic implementation timelines and expectations.

The overall strategy emphasizes careful, phased deployment to ensure sustainable success. Beginning with pilot programs like AI-deas and the Policy Lab, the approach allows for testing and refinement of methods before broader implementation. This measured approach enables the incorporation of lessons learned from early phases into subsequent expansions.}

\subsection{6. Independent Oversight and Diverse Perspectives}

\notes{**Challenge**: AI initiatives often lack balanced guidance and oversight from diverse perspectives.

The Steering Group provides crucial oversight through representatives from various academic disciplines and professional services. Working with a cross-institutional team, it ensures balanced decision-making that considers multiple perspectives. The group maintains close connections with external initiatives like ELLIS, ICAIN, and Data Science Africa, enabling the university to benefit from and contribute to broader AI developments.}

\subsection{7. Addressing the Innovation Supply Chain}

\notes{**Challenge**: Academic innovations often struggle to connect with and address industry needs effectively.

The Industry Engagement initiative develops meaningful industrial partnerships through collaboration with the Strategic Partnerships Office, helping translate research into real-world solutions. The planned sciencepreneurship initiative aims to create a structured pathway from academic research to entrepreneurial ventures, helping ensure that innovations can effectively reach and benefit society.}}
