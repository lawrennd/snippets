\subsection{The Shifting Nature of Economic Value}

\notes{The evolution of economic value creation has gone through several distinct phases that help us understand where AI might take us:

1. Manufacturing Era (Post-WW2)
    * Power with manufacturers
    * Supply-driven economy
    * "If you manufactured something you could sell it to anyone"

2. Distribution Era (1970s-2000s)
    * Power shift to distributors
    * Supply chain optimization
    * Value in controlling distribution networks

3. Demand Control Era (Current)
    * Power in influencing demand
    * AI-driven preference shaping
    * Value in data and attention}

\slides{
### Economic Value Evolution

* Manufacturing → Distribution → Demand Control
* Power follows information flow
* AI amplifies demand control

\subsubsection{AI's Role in Value Creation}

The current shift is characterized by:

1. Information Flow
    * Rapid, interconnected data movement
    * AI as decision support
    * Algorithmic market making

2. Value Capture
    * Advertising and attention markets
    * Behavioral prediction
    * Preference manipulation

3. Worker Impact
    * From labor rights to data rights
    * Need for new protections
    * Collective data bargaining}

\slides{
### AI Impact Vectors

* Information flow acceleration
* Value capture through prediction
* Worker rights evolution
}

\notes{
\subsubsection{Investment Implications}

This evolution suggests several key investment considerations:

1. Platform Economics
    * Value in demand prediction
    * Data network effects
    * Market-making capabilities

2. Worker Relations
    * Data rights importance
    * New collective bargaining
    * Privacy regulations

3. Market Structure
    * Platform concentration
    * Regulatory response
    * New intermediaries

The key insight is that AI isn't just automating existing processes - it's fundamentally shifting where and how economic value is created and captured.}
