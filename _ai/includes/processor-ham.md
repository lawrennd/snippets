\subsection{Human Analogue Machine}

\notes{Recent breakthroughs in generative models, particularly large language models, have enabled machines that, for the first time, can converse plausibly with other humans.}

\notes{The Apollo guidance computer provided Armstrong with an analogy when he landed it on the Moon. He controlled it through a stick which provided him with an analogy. The analogy is based in the experience that Amelia Earhart had when she flew her plane. Armstrong's control exploited his experience as a test pilot flying planes that had control columns which were directly connected to their control surfaces.}

\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/ai/processor-ham}{40%}}{The human analogue machine is the new interface that large language models have enabled the human to present. It has the capabilities of the computer in terms of communication, but it appears to present a "human face" to the user in terms of its ability to communicate on our terms.

\notes{The generative systems we have produced do not provide us with the "AI" of science fiction. Because their intelligence is based on emulating human knowledge. Through being forced to reproduce our literature and our art they have developed aspects which are analogous to the cultural proxy truths we use to describe our world.}

\notes{These machines are to humans what the MONIAC was the British economy. Not a replacement, but an analogue computer that captures some aspects of humanity while providing advantages of high bandwidth of the machine.}
