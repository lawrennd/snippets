\notes{Human communication is not only words passed between individuals. We also communicate through *shared artefacts* --- images, stories, rituals, institutions --- that act as a common reference frame. These artefacts stabilise meaning because they persist, they can be revisited, and they can be interpreted together.}

\notes{This version of the “human culture interacting” diagram grounds the idea in a concrete chain: the Sistine Chapel as a shared cultural object; Michelangelo’s figures as a visual vocabulary; Blake’s *Newton* borrowing a pose from a lunette; and Blake’s *Elohim Creating Adam* reinterpreting the creation narrative. In other words: a human communication network made of artefacts.}
