\section{Edge Computing Challenges}
\notes{The shift towards edge computing in AI represents both significant opportunities and challenges for the technology sector. This transition is being driven by several factors:

1. Data Privacy & Sovereignty
   - Increasing regulatory pressure (GDPR, CCPA)
   - Growing consumer privacy concerns
   - Data localization requirements

2. Latency Requirements
   - Real-time applications need immediate responses
   - Autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, industrial robotics
   - Cannot afford cloud round-trip delays

3. Bandwidth Constraints
   - Growing data volumes from IoT devices
   - Limited network capacity in many areas
   - Cost of data transmission

4. Energy Efficiency
   - Edge processing can reduce data center load
   - Lower overall power consumption
   - Smaller carbon footprint

These drivers create several investment implications:

* Hardware Evolution
  - New processor architectures optimized for edge AI
  - Specialized AI accelerators
  - Energy-efficient computing solutions

* Market Structure
  - Shift from centralized cloud to distributed edge
  - New players in edge-specific hardware/software
  - Potential disruption of current cloud leaders

* Infrastructure Requirements
  - Edge data centers and compute nodes
  - Enhanced networking capabilities
  - Power management solutions

* Business Models
  - Move from OpEx (cloud) to CapEx (edge) spending
  - New revenue streams from edge services
  - Changed competitive dynamics}
