\subsection{Bandwidth vs Complexity}

\notes{The computer communicates in Gigabits per second, One way of imagining just how much slower we are than the machine is to look for something that communicates in nanobits per second.}

\figure{\include{_ai/includes/communication-rates-ecology-human-computer.html}}{When we look at communication rates based on the information passing from one human to another across generations through their genetics, we see that computers watching us communicate is roughly equivalent to us watching organisms evolve. Estimates of germline mutation rates taken from @Scally-mutation16.}{communication-rates-ecology-human-computer}

\notes{The challenge we face is that while speed is on the side of the machine, complexity is on the side of our ecology. Many of the risks we face are associated with the way our speed undermines our ecology and the machines speed undermines our human culture.}
