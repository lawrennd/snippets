\subsection{Example: Pico Language Models}

\notes{[Pico](https://www.picolm.io/) is a modular language model development toolkit that embodies the attention reinvestment principles. Rather than focusing on building ever-larger models for commercial deployment, Pico makes small language model research accessible and systematic.}

\slides{
* Modular toolkit for small language models (1M-1B parameters)
* Research-ready framework for systematic experimentation
* Open science approach to understanding learning dynamics
}

\notes{The project consists of two core libraries: `pico-train` for model training and `pico-analyze` for studying learning dynamics. By providing rich training checkpoints and comprehensive analysis tools, Pico frees researchers' attention from infrastructure concerns, allowing them to focus on understanding how models learn.}

\notes{This freed attention creates value that gets reinvested in the research community through open-source tools, shared models, and published insights. The result is a more accessible research ecosystem where understanding - not just performance - is the primary goal. Recent papers using Pico have explored convergence patterns and frequency bias in language models, advancing our fundamental understanding of these systems.}
