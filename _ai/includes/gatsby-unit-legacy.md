\notes{The Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London was founded by Geoffrey Hinton, who would later win the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, the Unit became "a phenomenal draw" for talent. Its impact is evident in its role nurturing future leaders in AI. Demis Hassabis conducted his postdoctoral research there.}

\notes{In this Guardian article Maneesh Sahani (current directory) calls this "a chain reaction" - when critical mass is achieved, "people who are doing exciting things and talking to each other" attract others who want to participate.}

\notes{As Dame Wendy Hall notes in the article, "It takes 20 years or more to grow a research star like Hassabis. They don't just fall out of the trees."}
