\subsection{AI Energy Challenges}

\notes{The energy consumption of artificial intelligence systems presents both immediate challenges and long-term strategic considerations for the industry:

\subsubsection{Current State}

1. Training Costs
    * GPT-4 estimated at 8,000 tons CO2 equivalent
    * Comparable to 1,750 cars' annual emissions
    * $10-100 million in energy costs per large model

2. Inference Costs
    * Growing faster than expected
    * ChatGPT estimated at 500MW daily
    * Equivalent to 40,000 US households

3. Data Center Impact
    * AI driving 10-15% of data center growth
    * Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) improvements slowing
    * Location increasingly driven by power availability}

\slides{
### Energy Impact

* Training: Massive one-time cost
* Inference: Growing ongoing demand
* Infrastructure: Power shapes geography
}

\notes{
\subsubsection{Strategic Implications}

1. Geographic Shifts
    * Movement to renewable-rich regions
    * Nordic countries attracting data centers
    * Power availability as competitive advantage

2. Technical Evolution
    * Smaller, more efficient models emerging
    * Edge computing reducing transmission needs
    * New architectures for energy efficiency

3. Business Model Impact
