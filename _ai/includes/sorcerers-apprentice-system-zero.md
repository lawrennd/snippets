\notes{The Sorcerer’s Apprentice is a story about *delegation without controllability*: a tool takes over a task, but the human can’t stop it cleanly.}

\notes{“System Zero” is the modern version: we build systems that operate at machine speed, across many interfaces, and we gradually lose the practical capacity to audit, pause, or override them. The risk isn’t “AI becomes conscious”; it’s that the system becomes *unaccountable infrastructure*.}
