\notes{Imagine human communication as moving at walking pace. The average person speaks about 160 words per minute, which is roughly 2000 bits per minute. If we compare this to walking speed, roughly 1 m/s we can think of this as the speed at which our thoughts can be shared with others.

Compare this to machines. When computers communicate, their bandwidth is 600 billion bits per minute. Three hundred million times faster than humans or the equiavalent of $3 \times 10 ^{8}$. In twenty minutes we could be a kilometer down the road, where as the computer can go to the Sun and back again..

This difference is not just only about speed of communication, but about embodiment. Our intelligence is locked in by our biology: our brains may process information rapidly, but our ability to share those thoughts is limited to the slow pace of speech or writing. Machines, in comparison, seem able to communicate their computations almost instantaneously, anywhere.

So, the embodiment factor is the ratio between the time it takes to think a thought and the time it takes to communicate it. For us, it's like walking; for machines, it's like moving at light speed. This difference means that most direct comparisons between human and machine need to be carefully made. Because for humans not the size of our communication bandwidth that counts, but it's how we overcome that limitation..}
