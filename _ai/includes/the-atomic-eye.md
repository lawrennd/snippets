\subsection{The Atomic Human}

\figure{\includediagramclass{\diagramsDir/ai/atomic-eye}{45%}}{The Atomic Eye, by slicing away aspects of the human that we used to believe to be unique to us, but are now the preserve of the machine, we learn something about what it means to be human.}{the-atomic-eye}

\notes{The development of what some are calling *intelligence* in machines, raises questions around what machine intelligence means for our intelligence. The idea of the atomic human is derived from Democritus's atomism.}

\notes{In the fifth century [bce]{.smallcaps} the Greek philosopher Democritus
posed a similar question about our physical universe. He imagined
cutting physical matter into pieces in a repeated process: cutting a
piece, then taking one of the cut pieces and cutting it again so that
each time it becomes smaller and smaller. Democritus believed this
process had to stop somewhere, that we would be left with an indivisible
piece. The Greek word for indivisible is *atom*, and so this theory was
called *atomism*. This book considers this question, but in a different
domain, asking: As the machine slices away portions of human
capabilities, are we left with a kernel of humanity, an indivisible
piece that can no longer be divided into parts? Or does the human
disappear altogether? If we are left with something, then that
uncuttable piece, a form of atomic human, would tell us something about
our human spirit.}
