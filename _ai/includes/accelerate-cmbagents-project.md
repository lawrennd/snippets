\subsection{Example: CMBAgents}

\notes{[CMBAgents](https://github.com/CMBAgents) represents another application of the attention reinvestment cycle - this time in automating aspects of scientific research itself. The project develops open-source, research-ready multi-agent systems to automate scientific discovery, powered by the AG2 framework.}

\slides{
* Multi-agent systems for automating scientific discovery
* Open-source research backend (`cmbagent`)
* End-to-end research system (`Denario`)
}

\notes{The system includes specialized components: `cmbagent` provides an autonomous research backend, `Denario` offers end-to-end research capabilities, and `Synapses` creates domain-specific code assistants with leaderboards. Rather than replacing researchers, these tools free their attention from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on creative and interpretive aspects of research.}

\notes{The attention freed by these tools is reinvested through the open-source community - the code is freely available, documented through YouTube tutorials, and designed to be research-ready. This creates a knowledge network where improvements and best practices can be shared across research groups, building collective capacity in AI-assisted research methods.}

\slides{
* Autonomous research tools free researcher attention
* Value reinvested through open-source sharing
* Building capacity for AI-assisted research
}

\notes{Both Pico and CMBAgents demonstrate how AI research itself can embody the attention reinvestment cycle. By making tools openly available and focusing on building capacity rather than capturing value, these projects show an alternative pathway for innovation - one that serves the broader research community and ultimately society.}
