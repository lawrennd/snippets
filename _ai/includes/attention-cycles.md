\subsection{The Battle for Attention}

In our modern digital landscape, we find ourselves caught between two competing cycles: the attention capture cycle and the attention reinvestment cycle.

\subsection{The Attention Capture Cycle}

The attention capture cycle is characterized by:

* Algorithmic targeting of our attention
* Short-term engagement metrics
* Dopamine-driven feedback loops
* Erosion of deep thinking and reflection
* Commoditization of human attention

\subsection{The Attention Reinvestment Cycle}

In contrast, the attention reinvestment cycle involves:

* Conscious direction of attention
* Development of deep understanding
* Building of lasting knowledge and skills
* Creation of meaningful connections
* Investment in human capital

\subsection{Breaking Free}

The challenge of our time is to break free from the capture cycle and cultivate reinvestment. This requires:

* Awareness of how our attention is being targeted
* Active choices about technology use
* Development of metacognitive skills
* Creation of spaces for deep work and reflection

\notes{The attention capture cycle represents a form of cognitive extractivism, where human attention is harvested for profit. The attention reinvestment cycle offers a path to reclaim our cognitive sovereignty and invest in our collective future.}
