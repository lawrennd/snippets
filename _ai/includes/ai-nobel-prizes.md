\notes{\subsection{AI Nobel Prizes}}

\notes{In 2024, artificial intelligence researchers were recognized with Nobel Prizes in both Physics and Chemistry.}

\notes{The Physics prize was awarded jointly to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton "for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks".}

\notes{The Chemistry prize was shared between David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper "for computational protein design and protein structure prediction". }

\notes{These awards mark a pivotal moment in the history of artificial intelligence, recognizing both the theoretical foundations laid in the 1980s and the recent breakthroughs that have transformed the technology into a powerful scientific tool. The prizes highlight how AI has evolved from an academic pursuit into a transformative force across multiple scientific disciplines.}

\notes{The recognition of British-educated researchers Hinton and Hassabis also underscores the UK's significant contributions to AI development, reflecting a legacy of pioneering work in computer science and artificial intelligence stretching back to Alan Turing.}
