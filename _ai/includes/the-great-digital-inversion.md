\notes{
We're witnessing what I call "The Great Digital Inversion" - a fundamental shift in the relationship between humans and machines.

Since the dawn of computing, humans have had to adapt to machines. We've learned programming languages, memorized commands, navigated complex interfaces, and generally molded our thinking to match the rigid logic of computers. The burden of translation has always fallen on humans.

The latest wave of machine learning technology is inverting this relationship. For the first time, we're creating systems that can understand and adapt to human expressions, preferences, and ways of thinking. Instead of humans learning machine languages, machines are learning human languages. Instead of humans adapting to computer workflows, computers can adapt to human workflows.

This inversion represents perhaps the most significant shift in computing since the graphical user interface. It's not just about making technology more accessible - it's about fundamentally changing who bears the cognitive burden in the human-machine relationship.
