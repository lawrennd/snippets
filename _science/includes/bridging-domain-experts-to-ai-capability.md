\notes{There are two distinct forms of understanding systems: intellectual understanding and empirical understanding. Just as a cyclist doesn't need to intellectually understand the physics of countersteering to ride a bicycle, we don't need to fully understand AI systems to use them effectively. What we need is predictable behavior that responds reliably to our interventions.}

\slides{
* Two types of understanding:
  * Intellectual understanding (theory)
  * Empirical understanding (practice)
* Need to bridge between:
  * Domain expertise
  * AI capabilities
  * Institutional knowledge
}

\notes{The challenge we face is bridging the gap between domain expertise and AI capability. This requires:
1. Tight integration of research and practice
2. Bringing together academia, industry, and government
3. Universities acting as 'honest brokers'
4. Building feedback mechanisms into deployments}

\notes{When we fail to bridge this gap, we create what can be called an "affordance gap" - where digital systems undermine rather than enhance both individual and institutional capabilities. The Horizon scandal and Lorenzo project demonstrate the devastating consequences of failing to integrate proper feedback mechanisms and domain expertise into technological deployments.}
