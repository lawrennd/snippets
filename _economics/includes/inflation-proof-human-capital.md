\subsection{Inflation Proof Human Capital}

\slides{* Does automation totally displace the human?
* Or is there an irreducible core?}

\notes{Will AI totally displace the human? Or is there any form, a core, an irreducible element of human attention that the machine cannot replace? If so, this would be a robust foundation on which to build our digital futures.}

\subsection{Uncertainty Principle}

\slides{* Machines rely on measurable outputs
  * Quantified aspects of humans *easier to automate*
  * Essential aspects of humanity are the *hardest to measure*
* Implies: atomic human is *difficult to quantify*}

\notes{Unfortunately, when we seek it out, we are faced with a form of uncertainty principle. Machines rely on measurable outputs, meaning any aspect of human ability that can be quantified is at risk of automation. But the most essential aspects of humanity are the hardest to measure.}

\notes{So, the closer we get to the atomic human the more difficult it is to measure the value of the associated human attention.}
