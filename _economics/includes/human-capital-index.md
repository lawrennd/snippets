\subsection{Human Capital Index}

\notes{The World Bank's [human capital index](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/93f8fbc6-4513-58e7-82ec-af4636380319) is one area where many European countries are leading international economy, or at least an area where they currently outperform both the USA and China. The index is a measure of education and health of a population.}

\notes{> Technological progress disrupts existing systems. A new social contract is needed to smooth the transition and guard against rising inequality. Significant investments in human capital throughout a person’s lifecycle are vital to this effort.
