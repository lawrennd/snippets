\subsection{Homo Atomicus}

\slides{* Not in A-level results
* Not in hospital waiting lists
* In the quality of human interaction}

\notes{We wonâ€™t find the atomic human in the percentage of A grades that our children are achieving at schools or the length of waiting lists we have in our hospitals. It sits behind all this. We see the atomic human in the way a nurse spends an extra few minutes ensuring a patient is comfortable or a bus driver pauses to allow a pensioner to cross the road or a teacher praises a struggling student to build their confidence.}

\notes{We need to move away from homo economicus towards homo atomicus.}
