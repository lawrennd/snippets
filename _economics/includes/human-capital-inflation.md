\subsection{Inflation of Human Capital}

\slides{* Strength in Human Capital double edged sword.
* Automation creates efficiency.
* But skills risk becoming redundant.}

\notes{This transformation creates efficiency. But it also devalues the skills that form the backbone of human capital and create a happy, healthy society. Had the alchemists ever discovered the philosopherâ€™s stone, using it would have triggered mass inflation and devalued any reserves of gold. Similarly, our reserve of precious human capital is vulnerable to automation and devaluation in the artificial intelligence revolution. The skills we have learned, whether manual or mental, risk becoming redundant in the face of the machine.}
