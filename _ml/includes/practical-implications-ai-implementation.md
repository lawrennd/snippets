\subsection{Practical Implications for Industry}

\slides{
* Design for continuous monitoring and adaptation
* Invest early in robust system architecture
* Maintain human expertise in the loop
}

\notes{Drawing from experience deploying machine learning systems at scale, there are several critical lessons for organizations looking to implement AI in practice. First, the world changes around our deployed systems, requiring continuous monitoring and the ability to adapt. Second, intellectual debt accrues quickly if we don't invest early in proper system design. Third, particularly in domains like healthcare and pharmaceuticals, maintaining human expertise and oversight is not just advisable—it's essential.}
