\subsection{Information Engines: Intelligence as Thermodynamic Work}

\notes{
An information engine converts information into useful work. The classic example is Maxwell's demon - a hypothetical entity that observes the velocities of gas molecules and operates a trap door to separate fast and slow molecules, creating a temperature gradient that could potentially do work.

The resolution of this apparent paradox came through recognizing that information processing itself requires energy. The demon must expend energy to acquire and process information about the molecules, and this energy cost prevents violation of the second law of thermodynamics.

This insight provides a powerful metaphor for intelligence. Intelligent systems can be viewed as information engines that:

1. Acquire information about their environment (measurement)
2. Process this information to update their internal models (computation)
3. Use these updated models to generate useful work (action)

Each of these steps has an energetic cost, and the efficiency of this process can serve as a measure of intelligence. More intelligent systems extract more useful work from the same amount of information, or require less information to achieve the same work.

In the entropy game framework, each question represents an information acquisition step, with an associated cost. The efficiency with which questions reduce entropy directly parallels how information engines convert information to useful work.

* Maxwell's demon thought experiment:
  * Observes molecular velocities
  * Operates door to separate fast/slow molecules
  * Creates temperature gradient (useful work)
  * Appears to decrease entropy

* Resolution: Information processing requires energy
  * Measurement has thermodynamic cost
  * Intelligence bound by physics

* Intelligence as information engine:
  * Convert information â†’ useful work
  * Efficiency = work output / information input

\slides{
* The intelligent cycle:
  1. Observe (acquire information)
  2. Process (update model)
  3. Act (generate work)
  4. Repeat

* Each step has energetic cost
* Intelligence maximizes efficiency
* Entropy game: Each question = one cycle
