\subsection{Access, Assess, Address Framework}

\notes{Over the course of this module we will end up reusing a lot of the code we create. This is on purpose, and a very important aspect of creating data science pipelines. The goal of this section is to put this idea in practice.

Have a *skim* through Neil Lawrence's article on the Access Assess Address data science framework [here](https://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/access-assess-address-a-pipeline-for-automated-data-science.html).}

\notes{The Access-Assess-Address framework provides a systematic approach to data science projects:

- **Access**: How do we get the data? This includes APIs, web scraping, database queries, file formats, etc.
- **Assess**: How do we evaluate data quality, understand its structure, and validate our assumptions?
- **Address**: How do we answer the specific question or solve the problem at hand?}

\subsection{Applying the Framework}

\notes{Using the lessons from the article, have a look at the functionality you created, and identify generalisable Access, Assess and Address functionality that could come in useful in the future.}

\exercise{**Access functionality** we've created:
- `plot_city_map()`: Downloads and visualizes OSM data for any location
- `get_feature_vector()`: Extracts quantitative features from geographic coordinates
- Connection to OpenStreetMap API via OSMnx

**Assess functionality** we've created:
- Visualization of geographic data to understand structure
- Feature counting and summarization
- Data quality checks (handling missing data, failed queries)
- Dimensionality reduction for pattern visualization

**Address functionality** we've created:
- Machine learning pipeline for location classification
- Evaluation on test sets
- Analysis of model performance and potential biases}

\notes{Consider creating a reusable library structure:

```python
# access.py
def plot_city_map(place_name, latitude, longitude, box_size_km=2, poi_tags=None):
    # Access and visualize geographic data
    pass

def get_osm_features(latitude, longitude, box_size_km=2, tags=None):
    # Access raw OSM data
    pass

# assess.py  
def get_feature_vector(latitude, longitude, box_size_km=2, features=None):
    # Assess and quantify geographic features
    pass

def visualize_feature_space(X, y, method='PCA'):
    # Assess data distribution and separability
    pass

# address.py
def train_location_classifier(X_train, y_train, model_type='logistic'):
    # Address classification problem
    pass

def evaluate_classifier(model, X_test, y_test):
    # Address evaluation of performance
    pass
```}

\notes{This modular approach makes code reusable across different projects and enables systematic data science workflows. Each module has a clear responsibility within the overall pipeline.}
