\subsection{Energy and Intelligence}

\slides{
* Intelligence requires energy to operate
* Two fundamental resources:
    * Time
    * Free Energy
* Free energy is the capacity to do work
* Intelligence optimizes use of these resources
}

\notes{
In the physical universe, any form of intelligence - whether biological or artificial - must operate within the constraints of fundamental physical laws. The two most critical resources that bound intelligent behavior are:

1. Time: The duration required to achieve a desired state change
2. Free Energy: The portion of total energy available to perform useful work

While total energy in a closed system is conserved (first law of thermodynamics), free energy represents the energy available for useful work. This distinction is crucial because:

* Not all energy can be converted to useful work
* Some energy is always lost to entropy (second law of thermodynamics)
* Intelligent systems must optimize their use of available free energy

This framework allows us to quantify intelligence in terms of how efficiently a system uses these fundamental resources to achieve its objectives.

\notes{
The connection between intelligence and thermodynamics was first explored in Leo Szilard's seminal 1929 paper, which showed that the act of measurement and decision-making by an intelligent being has an associated energy cost. This established a fundamental link between information processing (a key aspect of intelligence) and physical resources.
