\subsection{Geospatial Data}

\notes{In data science and machine learning geospatial data is particularly common and important. Location is the most shared between datasets. Many good example datasets, and easy to contextualise and visualise.

Open Street Maps (OSM) is an open geographic database that can provide useful information about different locations and places on the planet. In this example, we will download data about Nyeri, Kenya and compare it with Cambridge, England.}

\notes{Geospatial data provides rich information about the world around us. It can help us understand patterns in urban development, economic activity, cultural differences, and infrastructure distribution. By analyzing features like amenities, buildings, and points of interest, we can build machine learning models that capture the essence of different places.}
