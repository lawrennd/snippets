\newslide{Key Takeaways}

\slides{
* Translation requires new engineering practices
* Human expertise remains central
* Success depends on trustworthy, interpretable systems
}

\notes{The challenge of translating AI into practice is not just technical—it's fundamentally about how we integrate machine intelligence with human intelligence. In sectors like pharmaceuticals, where the consequences of decisions affect human lives, this integration must prioritize trust, transparency, and human oversight. The future belongs not to systems that replace human experts, but to those that amplify human capabilities while maintaining the essential human qualities of judgment, responsibility, and care.}
