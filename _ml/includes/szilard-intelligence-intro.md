\subsection{Szilard Intelligence}

The objective is to provide a mathematical definition of intelligence that grounds our intelligence in the physical sciences. Previous efforts at mathematically defining universal intelligence have reviewed the literature to distil the facets of intelligence, taking a descriptive approach to modeling intelligence. 

Our definition is inspired by statistical mechanics descriptions of the universe and the simple idea that an intelligent decision is one that achieves a desired state change within the universe with the minimal use of resource. From a physical perspective there are two principal resources we can consider:

* Time 
* Energy

In practice energy is conserved, so the resource of interest is *free energy* - the energy available to us to do work.

\notes{This work builds on ideas from Leo Szilard's 1929 paper "On the decrease of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings" which established fundamental connections between information and thermodynamics.}
