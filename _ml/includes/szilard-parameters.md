\subsection{Parameters and Domain Fidelity}

\slides{
* Key Parameters:
    * Resource Efficiency (η)
    * Domain Coverage (C)
    * Mapping Accuracy (M)
* Combined in Domain Fidelity Score
}

\notes{
To make the Szilard framework practical, we need measurable parameters. Three key parameters characterize an intelligent system's performance:

1. Resource Efficiency (η): How efficiently the system uses energy and time
2. Domain Coverage (C): The proportion of valid domain space the system can access
3. Mapping Accuracy (M): The precision of state transformations
}

\slides{
* Domain Fidelity Components:
    * $F_D = η × C × M$
    * Each component ∈ [0,1]
    * Perfect system → $F_D = 1$
}

\notes{
Domain Fidelity ($F_D$) can be decomposed into its constituent parameters:

$F_D = η × C × M$

Where:
* η (Resource Efficiency) = $\frac{\text{Minimum Theoretical Resources}}{\text{Actual Resources Used}}$
* C (Domain Coverage) = $\frac{\text{Accessible Valid States}}{\text{Total Valid States}}$
* M (Mapping Accuracy) = $\frac{\text{Successful Transformations}}{\text{Attempted Transformations}}$

Each parameter is bounded between 0 and 1, with 1 representing perfect performance.

* Practical Applications:
    * System Evaluation
    * Performance Optimization
    * Design Decisions
    * Resource Planning

\notes{
This parameterization provides practical tools for:

1. Evaluating System Performance:
   * Identify bottlenecks in intelligence
   * Compare different systems objectively
   * Track improvements over time

2. Optimization Strategies:
   * Target specific parameters for improvement
   * Balance trade-offs between parameters
   * Allocate development resources effectively

3. Design Decisions:
   * Choose appropriate architectures
   * Set realistic performance targets
   * Define success metrics
}

\notes{
The relationship between these parameters and the overall Szilard Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) is:

$SIQ = F_D × \text{System Specific Factors}$

This relationship acknowledges that while domain fidelity is crucial, other system-specific factors may influence overall intelligence. These might include:
* Environmental constraints
* Problem-specific requirements
* Implementation limitations
