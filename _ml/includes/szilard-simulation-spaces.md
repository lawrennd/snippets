\subsection{Simulation Spaces and Domain Mapping}

\slides{
* Intelligence operates across different spaces:
    * Null Space: What's impossible
    * Domain Space: What's possible
* Key concepts:
    * Separability
    * Domain Fidelity
    * State Mapping
}

\notes{
In the Szilard framework, intelligent systems operate by mapping between different spaces. Two fundamental spaces are particularly important:

1. The Null Space: This represents states or transformations that are physically impossible or prohibited by the laws of nature.
2. The Domain Space: This represents the set of all possible valid states or transformations available to the system.
}

\slides{
* Intelligent systems must:
    * Recognize impossible states
    * Efficiently navigate possible states
    * Map between different domains
}

\notes{
The concept of separability is crucial in this framework. An intelligent system must be able to:

1. Distinguish between null and domain spaces
2. Efficiently identify valid state transformations
3. Minimize resource expenditure in mapping between states

The quality of this separation and mapping is measured by domain fidelity - how accurately and efficiently the system can represent and navigate its operational domain.
}

\notes{
Domain fidelity can be mathematically expressed as:

$F_D = \frac{\text{Correct Domain Mappings}}{\text{Total Attempted Mappings}}$

This measure relates directly to the SIQ, as higher domain fidelity generally correlates with more efficient resource usage. A system that frequently attempts invalid state transformations or fails to recognize impossible states will have lower efficiency and thus a lower SIQ.

\slides{
* Applications:
    * AI System Design
    * Learning Efficiency
    * Resource Allocation
    * Error Detection
}

\notes{
This framework has practical implications for:
* Designing AI systems that efficiently learn domain constraints
* Optimizing resource allocation in intelligent systems
* Developing better error detection and correction mechanisms
* Understanding the limitations and capabilities of different types of intelligence

The separation between null and domain spaces also helps explain why some problems are inherently harder than others - they may require more complex domain mapping or have less clear separation between possible and impossible states.
