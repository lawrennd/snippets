\subsection{Access-Assess-Address Framework in Practice}

\notes{We will use the DSAIL-Porini dataset to create a simple prediction model for the likelihood of animal sightings, following a minimal example of the Access-Assess-Address framework.

Reminder about Neil's article on the framework [here](https://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/access-assess-address-a-pipeline-for-automated-data-science.html).}

\subsubsection{Access}

\notes{Access is already largely done, partly years ago by the DSAIL team, and by us in the previous section. Example tasks within the Access phase include:

- Setting up the cameras in the woods (done by researchers)
- Collecting the pictures (done automatically by cameras)
- Labeling the dataset (done by DSAIL team)
- Making the excel file online accessible (done via Mendeley)
- Downloading the file (done by us in previous section)

The Access phase is about getting the data in a form where we can work with it computationally.}

\code{# Verify our data access
print(f"Dataset shape: {porini_df.shape}")
print(f"Columns: {list(porini_df.columns)}")
porini_df.head()}

\notes{This systematic approach to data access ensures reproducibility and provides a clear audit trail of data provenance - crucial for scientific research and production systems.}
