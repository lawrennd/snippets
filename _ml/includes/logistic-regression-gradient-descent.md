\subsection{Batch Gradient Descent}

\notes{We will need to define some initial random values for our vector and then minimize the objective by descending the gradient.}

\code{# Separate train and test
indices = np.random.permutation(X.shape[0])
num_train = np.ceil(X.shape[0]/2)
train_indices = indices[:num_train]
test_indices = indices[num_train:]
X_train = X.iloc[train_indices]
y_train = y.iloc[train_indices]==True
X_test = X.iloc[test_indices]
y_test = y.iloc[test_indices]==True}


\setupcode{import numpy as np}
\code{# gradient descent algorithm
w = np.random.normal(size=(X.shape[1]+1, 1), scale = 0.001)
eta = 1e-9
iters = 10000
for i in range(iters):
    g, Phi = predict(w, X_train, linear)
    w -= eta*gradient(g, Phi, y_train) + 0.001*w
    if not i % 100:
        print("Iter", i, "Objective", objective(g, y_train))}

\notes{Let's look at the weights and how they relate to the inputs.}

\setupcode{import matplotlib.pyplot as plt}
\code{print(w)}

\notes{What does the magnitude of the weight vectors tell you about the different parameters and their influence on outcome? Are the weights of roughly the same size, if not, how might you fix this?}

\code{g_test, Phi_test = predict(w, X_test, linear)
np.sum(g_test[y_test]>0.5)}

\subsection{Stochastic Gradient Descent}

\exercise{Now construct a stochastic gradient descent algorithm and run it on the data. Is it faster or slower than batch gradient descent? What can you do to improve convergence speed?}

\subsection{Using Statsmodels}

\notes{The statsmodels package provides a more convenient way to fit logistic regression models with additional statistical analysis capabilities.}

\setupcode{import statsmodels.api as sm}

\code{# Add constant term to X_train and X_test for intercept
X_train_sm = sm.add_constant(X_train)
X_test_sm = sm.add_constant(X_test)

# Fit logistic regression
model = sm.Logit(y_train, X_train_sm)
results = model.fit()

# Print summary of model results
print(results.summary())

# Make predictions on test set
y_pred = results.predict(X_test_sm)
print("\nTest set accuracy:", np.mean((y_pred > 0.5) == y_test))}

\notes{The statsmodels implementation provides additional statistical metrics like p-values, confidence intervals, and various diagnostic tests that can help evaluate the model's fit and assumptions.}
