\subsection{The Translation Challenge}

\newslide{From Research to Practice}

\slides{
* Machine learning research: controlled environments
* Real-world deployment: messy, evolving data
* The gap between prototype and production
}

\notes{Today I want to talk about one of the most significant challenges in modern AI: how we translate machine learning from research prototypes into robust, reliable systems that can operate in the real world. This challenge is particularly acute in industries like pharmaceuticals, where the stakes are high and the tolerance for error is low.}
