\subsection{Reflection on Linear Regression and Supervised Learning}

\notes{Think about:

1. What effect does the learning rate have in the optimization? 
  * What's the effect of making it too small? 
  * What's the effect of making it too big? 
  
2. Do you get the same result for both stochastic and steepest gradient descent?

3. Are there any advantages for stochastic gradient descent for small data?}

\slides{* Learning rate size
* Smaller data sets and variation in results}
