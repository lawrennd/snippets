\subsection{AI in Energy and Net Zero: Public Perspectives}

\notes{The energy and net zero discussions revealed support for AI's potential to optimize energy systems while raising questions about access and affordability.}

\slides{* Support for AI optimizing energy systems and grid management
* Concerns about equitable access and technology barriers
* Questions about infrastructure priorities
* Need to balance AI with fundamental climate action}

\notes{Participants saw clear benefits in using AI to improve energy efficiency and grid management, but worried about creating new inequalities through technology access barriers.}

\notes{Representative quotes include:}

> "Everybody being able to generate on their roofs or in their gardens, selling energy from your car back to the grid, power being thrown different ways at different times. You've got to be resilient and independent."
>
> Public Participant, Cambridge pg 20 @aicam-publicdialogue24

\newslide{AI in Energy and Net Zero: Public Perspectives}

> "Is the infrastructure not a more important aspect than putting in AI systems? Government for years now has known that we need that infrastructure, but it's always been someone else's problem, the next government to sort out."
>
> Public Participant, Liverpool pg 21 @aicam-publicdialogue24

\notes{A key theme was ensuring AI deployment in energy systems doesn't distract from fundamental changes needed to address climate change or exacerbate existing inequalities.}
