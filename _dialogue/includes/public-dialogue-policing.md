\slides{* Complex attitudes towards AI use.}

\notes{Participants emphasized that existing trust issues in policing need to be addressed before expanding AI use. They saw potential benefits in areas like crime pattern analysis but worried about bias and privacy implications.}

Key quotes reflect these concerns:

> "Trust in the police has been undermined by failures in vetting and appalling misconduct of some officers. I think AI can help this, because the fact is that we, as a society, we know how to compile information."
>

> "I'm brown skinned and my mouth will move a bit more or I'm constantly fiddling with my foot... I've got ADHD. If facial recognition would see my brown skin, and then I'm moving differently to other people, will they see me as a terrorist?"
>
> Public Participant, Liverpool pg 15 @aicam-publicdialogue24

\notes{The dialogue highlighted strong public desire for transparency and accountability in how AI is used in policing, with particular emphasis on preventing discriminatory outcomes.}
