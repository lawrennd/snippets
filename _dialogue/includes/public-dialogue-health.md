\subsection{AI in Healthcare: Public Perspectives}

\notes{In healthcare discussions, participants saw clear opportunities for AI to support NHS administration and improve service delivery, while expressing caution about AI involvement in direct patient care and diagnosis.}

\slides{Key aspirations include:

* Reducing administrative burden on clinicians
* Supporting early diagnosis and prevention
* Improving research and drug development
* Better management of complex conditions}

\notes{Participants identified several key aspirations for AI in healthcare. A major focus was on reducing the administrative workload that currently burdens healthcare professionals, allowing them to spend more time on direct patient care. There was strong support for AI's potential in early diagnosis and preventive care, where it could help identify health issues before they become severe. The public also saw significant value in AI accelerating medical research and drug development processes, potentially leading to new treatments more quickly. Finally, participants recognized AI's capability to help manage complex medical conditions by analyzing large amounts of patient data and identifying optimal treatment strategies. These aspirations reflect a pragmatic view of AI as a tool to enhance healthcare delivery while maintaining the central role of human medical professionals.}
