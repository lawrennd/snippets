\newslide{Generative AI Automation of Access-Assess-Address}

\slides{* *Access*: AI-assisted data discovery and legal compliance
* *Assess*: Automated schema detection and data quality assessment  
* *Address*: AI-powered analysis and visualization generation
* *Integration*: Tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini in Colab}

\notes{The emergence of generative AI tools is transforming how we approach the access-assess-address framework, automating many of the previously manual and time-consuming aspects of data science workflows.}

\subsection{GenAI-Enhanced Access}

\slides{* *Legal Compliance*: GenAI tools might help navigate complex licensing and data governance requirements
* *Data Discovery*: Automated identification of relevant datasets across multiple sources, GenAI tools as enhanced search
* *API Integration and Creation*: GenAI-assisted development of data connectors and extraction pipelines (boilerplate)
* *Document Processing*: Converting physical documents and unstructured data into machine-readable formats: text as data}

\notes{In the access phase, generative AI could help overcome some of the most persistent barriers. Legal compliance around data licensing, which is often a major bottleneck, could be assisted by GenAI tools. LLMs can often operate as enhanced search engines potentially improving data discovery. Perhaps one could identify relevant datasets across multiple repositories and suggest appropriate data sources for specific questions.}

\subsection{GenAI-Enhanced Assess}

\slides{* *Schema Detection*: Automated identification of data types, relationships, and quality issues
* *Data Profiling*: GenAI-generated summaries of data characteristics and potential problems
* *Quality Assessment*: Automated detection of missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
* *Metadata Generation*: GenAI-assisted creation of comprehensive data documentation}

\notes{The assess phase is perhaps where GenAI automation could make the most significant impact. Modern tools can automatically detect data schemas, identify data types, and flag potential quality issues. This automation can ensure that assessment work is more consistent and comprehensive than manual approaches, while also making the results more reusable across different projects. The GenAI can identify patterns that might be missed by human analysts working under time constraints.}

\subsection{GenAI-Enhanced Address}

\slides{* *Analysis Automation*: GenAI-generated statistical summaries and exploratory analysis
* *Model Selection*: Automated recommendation of appropriate analytical approaches
* *Visualisation*: GenAI-generated charts and dashboards give ability for quick exploration
* *Interpretation*: AI-assisted explanation of results and their implications}

\notes{In the address phase, AI tools can automate the generation of insights and their presentation. This includes everything from automated statistical analysis to the generation of appropriate visualisations. The AI can suggest analytical approaches based on the data characteristics and the question being asked, while also generating clear explanations of the results. The danger is that the AI often generates too much information. It should be used for exploration, but confirmation of the analysis path is needed before confirmation.}

\subsection{Current Tools and Integration}

\slides{* *Cursor*: GenAI-assisted code development with context-aware suggestions
* *GitHub Copilot*: Automated code generation and documentation
* *Gemini in Colab*: Integrated GenAI assistance for data analysis workflows
}

\notes{Several tools are already demonstrating the potential of this integration. Cursor provides GenAI-assisted code development that's particularly valuable for data science workflows, offering context-aware suggestions for data manipulation and analysis. GitHub Copilot automates many aspects of code generation and documentation. Google's Gemini integration with Colab brings GenAI assistance directly into the data analysis environment.}

\subsection{Possible Future Directions}

\slides{* *Seamless Integration*: more natural interaction between GenAI and human 
* *Domain Specialization*: tools tailored to specific data science areas
* *Collaborative AI*: systems that work alongside human data scientists
* *Continuous Learning*: for human and AI. Need to know more about the job, not less}

\notes{Looking forward, these tools may become more seamlessly integrated into the data science workflow. Rather than being separate applications. But it's important that the human remains in control, so the interface between human and generative AI becomes extremely important.}

\notes{It's also important to consider how the human data scientist will continue to learn. The availability of AI tools means you need to know more about your job, not less! Fortunately the tools can help you with some of the more tedious tasks, so you will have more time to learn.}

\notes{These tools don't replace the need for human judgment and domain expertise. Instead, they amplify human capabilities, allowing data scientists to focus on the higher-level aspects of their work while automating routine tasks. The successful data scientist of the future will be one who can effectively leverage these AI tools while maintaining critical thinking about the questions being asked and the validity of the answers being generated.}
