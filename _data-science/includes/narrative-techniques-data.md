\subsection{Narrative Techniques for Data Science Stories}

\slides{* *Show your analytical thinking* - Let visualizations reveal your reasoning
* *Use progressive disclosure* - Build complexity gradually
* *Ground in concrete examples* - Use specific cases to illustrate patterns
* *Acknowledge uncertainty* - Be honest about limitations and confidence levels
* *Focus on insights* - What new understanding emerged from your analysis?}

\notes{Data science narratives require techniques that help audiences follow your analytical reasoning and understand the insights you've discovered:}

\newslide{Show Your Analytical Thinking}

\slides{* Visualisations should reveal your reasoning process
* Each chart should answer: "What did I learn from this?"
* Show exploratory analysis, not just final results
* Use annotations to explain what you're seeing}

\notes{*Show your analytical thinking* means using visualisations to reveal how you reasoned through the data, not just what you concluded. Each chart should help readers understand what you learned at that step of your analysis.

Unlike journalism, where polished final visualisations dominate, data science narratives benefit from showing exploratory analysis. A scatter plot that reveals an unexpected relationship, a histogram that shows your data isn't normally distributed, or a time series that reveals seasonal patterns—these exploratory visualizations tell the story of discovery.}

\newslide{Progressive Disclosure}

\slides{* Start with your key finding or most interesting pattern
* Build analytical complexity step by step
* Show your methodology after establishing interest
* Provide detail for those who want to dig deeper}

\notes{*Progressive disclosure* in data science means starting with your most compelling finding to hook readers, then building the analytical complexity step by step. Don't lead with methodology—lead with discovery.

For example, start with "Customer churn increases 40% in winter months" before explaining your survival analysis methodology. Once readers are invested in the finding, they'll follow you through the technical details of how you discovered it.}

\newslide{Ground in Concrete Examples}

\slides{* Use specific data points to illustrate patterns
* Show individual cases alongside aggregate statistics
* Make abstract concepts concrete through examples
* Balance the general with the particular}

\notes{*Ground in concrete examples* means using specific data points to make abstract patterns tangible. Instead of just reporting "correlation coefficient of 0.73," show specific examples: "When temperature increased by 10°C, ice cream sales increased by an average of 15 units."

This isn't about human interest stories—it's about making statistical relationships concrete and understandable. Show both the forest (aggregate patterns) and individual trees (specific cases that illustrate those patterns).}
