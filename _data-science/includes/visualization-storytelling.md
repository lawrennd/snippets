\subsection{Visualisation for Storytelling}

\slides{* *Chart choice drives narrative* - Different charts tell different stories
* *Colour and annotation guide attention* - Direct the reader's eye
* *Sequence matters* - Order of presentation shapes understanding
* *Context is crucial* - Baselines, comparisons, and reference points}

\notes{Effective data visualization for storytelling goes beyond simply choosing the right chart type. Every visual element—from color choices to annotation placement—contributes to the narrative.}

\newslide{Chart Choice and Story}

\slides{* Line charts: Change over time, trends, trajectories
* Bar charts: Comparisons, rankings, categories
* Scatter plots: Relationships, correlations, outliers
* Maps: Geographic patterns, spatial relationships
* Small multiples: Comparisons across groups}

\notes{*Chart choice fundamentally shapes the story you tell.* A line chart emphasizes change over time and can suggest causation or trends. Bar charts focus attention on comparisons and rankings. Scatter plots reveal relationships and help identify outliers or unexpected patterns.

Consider the same dataset shown as a line chart (emphasizing trends) versus a bar chart (emphasizing comparisons) versus a map (emphasizing geographic patterns)—each tells a different story from the same underlying data.}

\newslide{The Power of Annotation}

\slides{* Highlight key insights directly on charts
* Provide context for unusual data points
* Guide readers through complex visualizations
* Explain methodology and limitations}

\notes{*Annotations are your storytelling superpower.* They guide readers' attention to the most important insights and provide context that might not be obvious from the data alone. Good annotations explain not just what happened, but why it matters.

*The New York Times'* data visualizations excel at this—they use arrows, callout boxes, and explanatory text to ensure readers don't miss key insights, even in complex multi-panel displays.}

\newslide{Color as Narrative Device}

\slides{* Use color to highlight key findings
* Maintain consistency across related charts
* Consider accessibility and color blindness
* Leverage cultural associations thoughtfully}

\notes{*Colour is a powerful narrative device* that can emphasize key findings, group related elements, or create emotional associations. However, it must be used thoughtfully—consider accessibility for color-blind readers, maintain consistency across related visualizations, and be aware of cultural associations (red for danger, green for growth, etc.).

*Reuters Graphics* demonstrates masterful use of color in their climate change visualizations, using warming colors (reds and oranges) to represent temperature increases in ways that are both scientifically accurate and emotionally resonant.}
