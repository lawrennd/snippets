\subsection{Learning from Data Journalism}

\slides{* Journalism inspiration for data science narratives:
  * *Structure*: Clear narrative arc and progression
  * *Clarity*: Making complex analysis accessible
  * *Transparency*: Showing methodology and limitations
  * *Engagement*: Keeping audience interested throughout
* Key difference: *Purpose*
  * *Journalism*: Inform public, drive action, expose issues
  * *Data Science*: Understand patterns, build models, generate insights}

\notes{Data journalism offers valuable lessons for data scientists, not in content but in craft. Journalists excel at structuring complex information, making technical analysis accessible, and maintaining audience engagement. However, the purposes differ fundamentally.

Data journalists typically seek to inform the public, drive policy changes, or expose societal issues. Data scientists aim to understand patterns, build predictive models, or generate insights that advance knowledge or business objectives. This difference in purpose shapes how we tell our stories.}

\newslide{Example: Narrative Techniques from Journalism}

\slides{* *The Guardian's "The Counted"*: Data collection as storytelling
  * Lesson: Transparency about data sources and methodology
  * Application: Explain how you gathered and cleaned your data
* *New York Times COVID-19*: Multiple scales and perspectives
  * Lesson: Present data at different levels of detail
  * Application: Show both individual observations and aggregate patterns
* *ProPublica's "Machine Bias"*: Statistical rigor with clear explanation
  * Lesson: Complex analysis can be made accessible
  * Application: Explain your statistical methods in plain language}

\notes{These journalism examples offer techniques we can adapt for data science narratives:

*Data collection transparency*: The Guardian's project showed how data was gathered, what was missing, and why that mattered. In data science, explaining your data sources, cleaning processes, and limitations builds credibility.

*Multiple perspectives*: The New York Times presented COVID data at national, state, and individual levels. Data scientists can similarly show both forest and trees—aggregate patterns and individual cases that illustrate those patterns.

*Accessible complexity*: ProPublica made sophisticated statistical analysis understandable to general audiences without sacrificing rigor. Data scientists can explain complex methods clearly while maintaining technical accuracy.}

\newslide{Adapting Journalism Techniques for Data Science}

\slides{* *From human drama to data drama*:
  * Unexpected correlations, surprising null results, model failures
* *From societal impact to analytical insight*:
  * What this reveals about the underlying system or process
* *From calls to action to informed understanding*:
  * How this changes what we know or how we might approach similar problems}

\notes{We can adapt story-telling techniques while staying true to data science purposes:

*Data drama* comes from unexpected findings—correlations that shouldn't exist, models that fail in interesting ways, or null results that challenge assumptions. To data scientists analytical surprises can be just as engaging as human drama. But they shouldn't be presented as a murder mystery. There is no need for building suspense. Keep the reader informed.

*Analytical insights* rWhat does your analysis reveals about underlying systems, processes, or relationships in the data.

*Informed understanding* how can you help readers understand your system better, or how can you help them approach similar analytical problems more effectively.}
