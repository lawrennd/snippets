\subsection{DSA: The Next Ten Years}

\notes{As Data Science Africa marks its 10th anniversary, we can envision how the next decade could position the continent as a global leader in human-centered AI and data science.}

\slides{
* 2015-2025: Foundation decade
* 2025-2035: Global leadership decade
* From catching up to setting direction
}

\notes{Data Science Africa has spent its first decade building foundations - establishing networks, developing local capacity, and demonstrating that African approaches to data science can be both rigorous and culturally grounded. The next decade presents an opportunity to move from building capacity to providing global leadership.

The question isn't whether Africa can catch up to existing models of data science - it's whether Africa can pioneer approaches that the rest of the world can learn from.}

\slides{
* Local solutions with global relevance
* African models for human-AI collaboration  
* Build talent and Export frameworks

\notes{The next ten years will see a paradigm shift in corporate best practices. African entrepeneurs have a chance to place them selves at the heart of that debate. Building on rich cultural heritage, and the individual innovation we see all around us on the continet. But the glue that holds this together is institutions. We need to improve the quality of software that African engineers are writing, share the fruits of their labour with each other. We need a model for open innovation in the AI era that places African cultural practices and African needs at its heart. African traditions show that there is an inate understanding of these practices, but to build the quality solutions that form the foundation of the future African innovation ecosystem that inate cultural knowledge needs to be translated into the institutions that will be the foundation of the 21st century.

This means moving beyond developing people to developing new institutions. Institutiosn that translate African capabilities into deployed innovations. No longer is it enoguh to just African capacity in data science, but to establish African approaches as essential components of global data science practice.}

\slides{* New institutions for a new era
* THe Continent is perfectly positioned to lead
}

\notes{DSA's first decade was has been founded on a set of principles that responded to African communities with African needs. But to translate these ideas into the innovations that are supporting African citizens to fulfil their aspirations we need every member of DSA to be striving to build their own visions of the future that are informed by the success that European institutional models have achieved but are not tethered by it.

\notes{DSA collaborations between between local data scientists and international partners are already characterised by mutual learning rather than one-way knowledge transfer. Why shouldn't this also be the case for new generation of AI-first companies?}
