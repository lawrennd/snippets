\subsection{Building Data Narratives}

\slides{* Every dataset has a story to tell
* Data science narratives vs journalism narratives:
  * *Journalism*: Human drama, societal impact, calls to action
  * *Data Science*: Analytical journey, patterns discovered, insights gained
* Three key elements remain:
  1. *Context* - Why is this data worth exploring?
  2. *Investigation* - What did you discover in the data?
  3. *Understanding* - What new knowledge emerged?}

\notes{In this course, we'd like our data narratives to be inspired by data journalism. But there are important differences. While both benefit from narrative structure, journalists normally seek human stories and societal impact, data scientists tell data stories. Data narratives also hope for societal impact, but often through a story of discovery and understanding, never through sensationalising or misrepresenting.

*Context* for a data scientist establishes why this particular dataset or question is worth investigating. It might be a business problem, a scientific hypothesis, or simply curiosity about patterns in available data.

*Investigation* —this is your analytical journey through the data. What patterns emerged? What hypotheses did you test? What surprised you during exploration? 

*Understanding* is your resolution—the new knowledge or insights gained from your analysis. This might be a predictive model, a deeper understanding of relationships in the data, or even the discovery that your initial assumptions were wrong.}

\newslide{The Data Science Narrative Arc}

\slides{* *Hook* - An intriguing pattern, unexpected finding, or compelling question
* *Setup* - The dataset, methodology, and analytical approach
* *Journey* - Your path through the data: dead ends, discoveries, iterations
* *Insights* - What the data revealed, with evidence and uncertainty
* *Implications* - How this advances understanding or informs decisions}

\notes{The data science hook might be an unexpected correlation you discovered, a counterintuitive pattern, or simply a well-posed analytical question. The setup explains your data sources, methodology, and analytical approach—transparency that builds trust.

The journey is crucial in data science narratives: show your analytical process, including false starts and iterative refinements. This isn't just methodological transparency—it's storytelling that helps readers understand how insights emerge from data.

Your insights should be presented with appropriate uncertainty and caveats. Unlike in normal story telling, data science narratives often conclude with "this suggests..." rather than definitive statements. The implications focus on how your analysis advances understanding or could inform future decisions.}
