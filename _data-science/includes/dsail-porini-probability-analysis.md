\subsection{Statistical Analysis of Sighting Patterns}

\codeassignment{Now let's create a simple prediction system for whether a specific `camera` captured a `species` on a given `date`. Let's use the whole dataset, except the prediction target date.

Before we jump into addressing the question, let's further assess the data. Calculate and plot average probabilities for dates, species, and cameras. You may want to implement some smoothing over dates, or group them into longer ranges.}{}{15}
