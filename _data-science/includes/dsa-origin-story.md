\notes{While Data Science Africa officially launched in 2015, its roots stretch back much further, emerging through a network of dedicated individuals and their collaborations.

The DSA story began for me when I met John Quinn at NeurIPS in 2005, where he published work on monitoring infants in neonatal intensive care. Once he had graduated he moved to Makerere University in Kampala. Fast forward another five years and we were together at a Dagstuhl Seminar, where I also met Ernest Mwebaze who was John's PhD student at the time.

I was really struck by Ernest's work. He presented on an algorithm for Crop Surveillance that was implemented on a $100 Android mobile phone. What struck me about Ernest's work was the scope of its ambition. The talk was about a learned vector quantisation algorithm, but the algorithm wasn't the point. The ambition was to place the algorithm in a farmer's hands in a field in Uganda. Ernest was collaborating with Uganda's national crop surveyors. The plan was to go end-to-end from the farmer's field to the ministry of agriculture. It was the first time in machine learning that I'd seen someone attempting to bring all those components together.}

* Focus on what actually works in practice
* End-to-end thinking: farmer's field to ministry
* Local context and partnerships matter
* Avoiding harmful international interventions

\notes{I was impressed with Ernest and John's work and wanted to find out more. John and Ernest were kind enough to invite me to Kampala for a research visit, I also suggested that I deliver some teaching while I was there. Two years later I visited John and Ernest with my PhD student Ricardo to deliver a short Gaussian process school. This was our first project together.

One thing I really enjoyed about the work there is on the fundamentals. I don't mean fundamentals in terms of the mathematical properties of algorithms, but fundamentals in terms of what things work and what don't. Working directly with farmers and the ministry of agriculture forces the focus to be on where the real challenges of successful deployment lie. They are rarely in the mathematics and compute but more often in the people and social environment where you are deploying.

There were lots of international projects in Kampala, and some (or many!) of them seemed to be quite clumsily implemented and harmful to local ecosystems.}

\newslide{From People to Projects to Purpose}

\slides{
* Started with relationships and curiosity
* Projects emerged from local needs
* Purpose crystallized through collaboration
* Natural evolution, not imposed structure

\notes{I don't think I left Kampala with a purpose in mind, but I had some early ideas for ways of working with my Kampalan collaborators. We also left with a further project. My student Ricardo and John's PhD student Martin Mubangizi would work together on malaria prediction. And the plan was to go from the Ugandan health centres to the Ugandan ministry of health. We had people and we now we had projects.

This early work demonstrates how meaningful initiatives often begin - not with grand strategic plans, but with people who share interests connecting around practical problems. The purpose emerges through the work itself, rather than being imposed from above.}
