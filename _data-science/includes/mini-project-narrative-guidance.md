\subsection{Building Narratives for Your Mini Projects}

\slides{* Apply the Access-Assess-Address framework narratively
* Each phase has storytelling opportunities:
  * *Access*: The quest for data
  * *Assess*: Discovery and exploration
  * *Address*: Insights and implications}

\notes{Your mini projects provide an excellent opportunity to practice building data narratives. The Access-Assess-Address framework naturally lends itself to storytelling, with each phase offering different narrative opportunities.}

\newslide{Access: The Quest for Data}

\slides{* Why this dataset? What drew you to it?
* What challenges did you face in obtaining/cleaning the data?
* What surprised you about the data collection process?
* How does the data's origin affect its reliability?}

\notes{*The Access phase is your data story's foundation.* Why did you choose this particular dataset? What challenges did you encounter in obtaining or cleaning the data? These challenges often reveal important insights about the data's limitations and biases. They may also include important social issues such as legal or ethical issues.

For example, if you're working with social media data, explain the API limitations, sampling biases, and temporal constraints. What might the ethical implicatiosn be of unrepresentative data? This isn't just methodological transparency—it's storytelling that helps readers understand what your analysis can and cannot reveal. Missing data often tells as interesting a story as the data you have.}

\newslide{Assess: Discovery and Exploration}

\slides{* What patterns emerged during exploration?
* Which findings surprised you?
* What assumptions were challenged?
* How did your understanding evolve?
* What dead ends did you encounter?}

\notes{*The Assess phase is your analytical journey.* This is where you take readers through your exploration—what patterns emerged? What surprised you? How did your understanding evolve as you dug deeper?

Embrace the messiness of real data analysis. Show the dead ends, the assumptions that were wrong, the patterns that disappeared under closer scrutiny. This isn't failure—it's the authentic process of learning from data. Your audience will trust your final insights more if they've seen your analytical reasoning.}

\newslide{Address: Insights and Understanding}

\slides{* What key insights emerged from your analysis?
* How confident are you in these findings?
* What are the limitations and caveats?
* What questions remain unanswered?
* How does this advance understanding of the domain?}

\notes{*The Address phase is your analytical resolution.* What key insights emerged from your analysis? Be honest about your confidence levels and limitations. What questions remain unanswered? How does your work advance understanding in this domain?

Unlike journalism, your "call to action" is often intellectual rather than practical: "This suggests we should reconsider our assumptions about X" or "Future work should investigate Y." The goal is advancing understanding, not necessarily driving immediate action.}

\newslide{Data Science Narrative Structure for Mini Projects}

\slides{1. *Hook*: Start with your most intriguing pattern or unexpected finding
2. *Context*: Why is this dataset worth exploring? What question drove your analysis?
3. *Journey*: Take readers through your analytical process, including false starts
4. *Insights*: Present key findings with appropriate uncertainty and evidence
5. *Understanding*: How does this advance knowledge? What would you explore next?}

\notes{Structure your mini project presentation as a data science narrative:

1. *Hook*: Start with your most compelling analytical finding—an unexpected correlation, a surprising null result, or an intriguing pattern that emerged from exploration.

2. *Context*: Establish why this dataset and analytical question are worth pursuing. This might be scientific curiosity, business relevance, or methodological interest.

3. *Journey*: Show your analytical process authentically—the hypotheses you tested, the methods you tried, the dead ends you encountered. This transparency builds credibility.

4. *Insights*: Present your findings with appropriate caveats and confidence levels. Use visualizations that reveal your analytical thinking, not just polished results.

5. *Understanding*: Focus on how your analysis advances understanding of the domain or analytical approach. What would you investigate next? What assumptions should be reconsidered?}
