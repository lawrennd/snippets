> My Leader,

> I am deeply shocked by the news that my son Erwin has been sentenced to death by the People’s Court.
> The recognition of my achievements in the service of our fatherland, which you repeatedly expressed in an honourable way, my Leader, entitles me to trust that you will listen to the request of an 87-year-old man.
>
> As a thank you from the German people for my life’s work, which has become an imperishable intellectual property of Germany, I ask for the life of my son.
>
> Max Planck
