\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/atomic-human/Atomic_H_2_Automatons}{60%}}{This is the drawing Dan was inspired to creat for Chapter 2. It captures part of the narrative where human actors choose to follow the spirit of their instructions, and are empowered to do so because they have wider context. They can operate autonomously. Whereas machines have typically operated on data and statistics and can't bring in context so normally operate as automatons.}{automatons-scribeysense}
