\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/atomic-human/Artificial_General_Vehicle_211224_Final}{70%}}{The notion of artificial general intelligence is as absurd as the notion of an artificial general vehicle - no single vehicle is optimal for every journey. (Illustration by Dan Andrews inspired by a conversation about "The Atomic Human" @Lawrence-atomic24)}{artificial-general-vehicle}

\notes{This illustration was created by Dan Andrews inspired by a conversation about "The Atomic Human" book. The drawing emerged from discussions with Dan about the flawed concept of artificial general intelligence and how it parallels the absurd idea of a single vehicle optimal for all journeys. The vehicle itself is inspired by shared memories of Professor Pat Pending in Hanna Barbera's *Wacky Races*.}
