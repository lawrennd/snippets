\notes{This Scribeysense image is Narcissus staring into his reflection (after Caravaggio’s *Narcissus*, housed in the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica in Rome). It’s a deliberately “mythic” framing: gods and robots are how we tempt ourselves to think about AI, but we also centre the intelligence in our context. It is a distorted reflection of us that fascinates us, whether or not that's how the technology operates. For leaders, that framing is usually a trap. The real risk is not a human-like entity that outsmarts us, but the scaling of *systems* that make (and automate) decisions, shaped by incentives and feedback loops. Keep the conversation anchored on decisions, information, failure modes, and accountability.}
