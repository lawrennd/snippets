\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/atomic-human/Atomic_H_8_System_Zero}{60%}}{This is the drawing Dan was inspired to create for Chapter 8. It captures the notion of Syztem Zero. The idea of System Zero is that the machine’s access to information is so much greater than ours that it can manipulate us in ways that exploit our cognitive foibles, interacting directly with our reflexive selves and undermining our reflective selves.}

\notes{System Zero is when the machine's access to our information is so much greater than ours it understands us in ways that we don't understand each other.}
