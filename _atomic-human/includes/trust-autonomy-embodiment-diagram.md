\notes{This illustration was created by Dan Andrews after reading
Chapter 3 "Intent" of "The Atomic Human" book. The chapter explores
the concept of intent in AI systems and how trust, autonomy, and
embodiment interact to shape our relationship with technology. Dan's
drawing captures these complex relationships and the balance needed
for responsible AI deployment.}
