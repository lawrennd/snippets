\notes{This illustration was created by Dan Andrews after reading Chapter 3 "Intent" of "The Atomic Human" book. The chapter explores the concept of intent in AI systems and how trust, autonomy, and embodiment interact to shape our relationship with technology. Dan's drawing captures these complex relationships and the balance needed for responsible AI deployment.}
