\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/atomic-human/Atomic_H_5_Enlightenment}{70%}}{The nature of digital communication has changed dramatically, with machines processing vast amounts of human-generated data and feeding it back to us in ways that can distort our information landscape.

\notes{This illustration was created by Dan Andrews after reading Chapter 5 "Enlightenment" of "The Atomic Human" book. The chapter examines how machine learning models like GPTs ingest vast amounts of human-created data and then reflect modified versions back to us. The drawing celebrates the stochastic parrots paper by @Bender-parrots21 while also capturing how this feedback loop of information can distort our digital discourse.}
