\notes{Individuals and cultures can be more dominated by their reflexive or their reflective self. The arguments I make in The Gremlin of Uncertainty suggest that McLaren and Ferrari (in previous incarnations when then were dominating the F1 championship) were respectively dominated by planning and improvisational approaches. Similarly, I describe my father and brother’s approach as being respectively dominated by planning and improvisational approaches. There’s even a roundabout connection to how an individual chooses to react to a situation, with a reflexive or a reflective response. What Kahneman called slow or fast thinking.}

\notes{Without knowing how much uncertainty we are facing, we don’t know which approach is better. In practice we see across individuals, cultures, nations and species that a diversity of approaches is taken. When we are certain planning can be more efficient, but it is less robust.}
