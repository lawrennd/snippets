\notes{Understanding the difference between imposed and organically grown institutions is key for building sustainable systems that truly serve their communities.}

\subsection{Imposed vs Organic Institutions}

\slides{
* Innovation high, quality often low in Africa
* Root cause: institutional mismatch
* Imposed structures vs natural strengths
}

\notes{African countries show incredibly high innovation potential, but can struggles with quality execution and sustained impact. Arguably this is an institutional problem. The structures of society operating on the continent were typically designed elsewhere and imposed. They embody assumptions about aspirations andcultural incentives that may not align with local cultural strengths and social structures.}

\newslide{The Cost of Institutional Mismatch}

\slides{
* Energy wasted on adaptation to foreign models
* Local strengths underutilised
* Sustainable impact limited
}

\notes{When institutions don't fit the cultural context, energy gets diverted into making them work. People spend time learning to operate within frameworks that don't align with their natural ways of organising and collaborating.}


\newslide{The Path Forward}

\slides{
* Start with cultural strengths
* Design institutions that amplify existing capabilities
* Export success models rather than importing failure patterns
}

\notes{We hear too many times the question "How can we make African communities work like Western institutions?", rather than the question what does an institution look like that builds on the strengths of communities on the continent and ameliorates the cultural weaknesses. One that empowers the innovative instincts of entrepeneurs but supports them in delivering the necessary quality that makes a their work scalable and sustainable.} 

\newslide{The AI Race}

\slides{
* International media talks of an AI race
* Such a race can only be a race to the bottom.
* In reality theirs an opportunity to reset.
}

\notes{With AI this is particularly important. The international media is driving a narrative around an AI "race". But what is the goal of this race? Without understanding that it can only be a race to the bottom. African countries have the opportunity to chose the game they place and set their own rules according to their citizens needs in a way that builds on thair cultural strengths.}
