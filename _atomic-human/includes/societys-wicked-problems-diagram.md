\notes{This illustration was created by Dan Andrews after reading the Epilogue of "The Atomic Human" book. The Epilogue discusses how we might deploy AI to address society's most pressing challenges, and Dan's drawing captures the various wicked problems we face and some of the initiatives that are looking to address them.}
