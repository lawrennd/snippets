\subsection{Bandwidth and Cultural Intelligence}

\notes{To deal with our bandwidth limitation, human cultures have developed a landscap around us which allows us to refer to ideas and collaborate. }

\slides{
* Human bandwidth: 2000 bits per minute
* Culture: provides landscape in which we communicate
* Different nations, tribes, towns and villages have different culture
}

\notes{The challenge of human-computer interaction hasn't been computational power, it's the limited understanding machines have had of human culture. The HAM puts that right.}

\subsection{Challenge for Africa}

\slides{
* Challenge for Africa
* Western institutions imposed
* Evolved in different cultural context
}

\notes{The 5 Ps framework allows these cultural ideas to emerge from the community and enhance the strength of the institution. By placing people, projects and purpose first and allowing principles and process to follow the processes enhance the strengths of the institutions that are formed.}
