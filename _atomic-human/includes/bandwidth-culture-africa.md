\notes{Human cultures have developed sophisticated approaches to managing information bandwidth that could inform more effective human-AI collaboration globally.}

\subsection{Bandwidth and Cultural Intelligence}

\slides{
* Human bandwidth: ~20 bits per second
* Culture: amplifies individual intelligence
* African approaches: collective problem-solving
}

\notes{The challenge of human-computer interaction isn't computational power - it's the bandwidth bottleneck between human consciousness and digital systems. Humans share around 2000 bits of information per minute, while digital systems share 600 billion bits per minute.

Humans have developed cultural technologies to overcome this limitation. Culture allows us to share the cognitive load across communities, preserve insights across generations, and coordinate complex activities despite individual bandwidth constraints. African societies have been particularly innovative in developing these cultural technologies.}

\notes{The 5 Ps framework allows these cultural ideas to emerge from the community and enhance the strength of the institution. By placing people, projects and purpose first and allowing principles and process to follow the processes enhance the strengths of the institutions that are formed.}
