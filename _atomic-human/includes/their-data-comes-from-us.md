\notes{The stochastic parrots paper [@Bender-parrots21] was the moment that the research community, through a group of brave researchers, some of whom paid with their jobs, raised the first warnings about these technologies. Despite their bravery, at least in the UK, their voices and those of many other female researchers were erased from the public debate around AI.}

\notes{Their voices were replaced by a different type of stochastic parrot, a group of "fleshy GPTs" that speak confidently and eloquently but have little experience of real life and make arguments that, for those with deeper knowledge are flawed in naive and obvious ways.}

\notes{The story is a depressing reflection of a similar pattern that undermined the UK computer industry @Hicks-programmed17.}

\notes{We all have a tendency to fall into the trap of becoming fleshy GPTs, and the best way to prevent that happening is to gather diverse voices around ourselves and take their perspectives seriously even when we might instinctively disagree.}
