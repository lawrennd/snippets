\notes{I often turn up to talks with my Brompton bicycle. Embarrassingly I even took it to Google which is only a 30 second walk from King's Cross station. That made me realise it's become a sort of security blanket. I like having it because it's such a flexible means of transport.}

\notes{But is the Brompton an "artificial general vehicle"? A vehicle that can do everything? Unfortunately not, for example it's not very good for flying to the USA. There is no artificial general vehicle that is optimal for every journey. Similarly there is no such thing as artificial general intelligence. The idea is artificial general nonsense.}

\notes{That doesn't mean there aren't different principles to intelligence we can look at. Just like vehicles have principles that apply to them. When designing vehicles we need to think about air resistance, friction, power. We have developed solutions such as wheels, different types of engines and wings that are deployed across different vehicles to achieve different results.}

\notes{Intelligence is similar. The notion of artificial general intelligence is fundamentally eugenic. It builds on Spearman's term "general intelligence" which is part of a body of literature that was looking to assess intelligence in the way we assess height. The objective then being to breed greater intelligences [@Lyons-assessing22].}
