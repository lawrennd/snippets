\subsection{Africa's HAM Advantage}

\slides{
* HAM: New interface between humans and digital systems
* Existing companies built for old information flows
* Opportunity to leapfrog legacy systems
}

\notes{The HAM represents a new paradigm for interaction between human and machine. It allows any human to directly leverage the machine's massive bandwidth capability. 

This has profound implications for all organisations. Corporate structures have evolved for processing and managing information, but when a radical new tool exists that allows us to change the way we manage information, existing corporate structures immediately become redundant.}

\newslide{"Path Dependence": The Legacy Disadvantage}

\slides{
* Established companies: using old paradigms
* Legacy systems resist fundamental change
* Sunk costs in outdated approaches: e.g. Bezos API Mandate
}

\notes{Economists call this "path dependence" - past investments constrain their future choices. They have entire organisations, training programs, and infrastructure built around organising the human machine interactions around outdated models, for example the Bezos API mandate. 

This means that being a late move organisationally can be an advantage. Countries and organizations that haven't locked themselves into legacy approaches have more freedom to adopt better paradigms.}

\newslide{Africa's Leapfrog Moments}

\slides{
* Less legacy infrastructure to abandon
* Opportunity to align with culture
* Opportunity to set global standards
}

\notes{DSA exploits the fact that Africa has leapfrogged in other technologies,  moving directly to mobile phones without extensive landline infrastructure. The HAM paradigm presents a similar opportunity.

Rather than trying to catch up to outdated models, you have the opportunity to pioneer approaches that the rest of the world will eventually need to adopt. }
