\newslide{Communication Through Artefacts}

\notes{We communicate with each other through shared cultural reference points: stories, rituals, and artefacts. Great artworks are not just decoration: they are *compressed* cultural objects that can carry meaning across centuries.}

\notes{The Sistine Chapel becomes a kind of public interface: a shared “model” that people can point at, interpret, dispute, and transmit. In that sense, the artwork itself is part of the communication system.}

}}{The creation of Adam and the Lunette of Abijah come to gether to influence Blake's version of Newton, yet his view of creation is very different from Michelangelo's.}{blake-michelangelo}

\notes{What’s striking here is how influence works: a pose moves from a Michelangelo lunette into Blake’s *Newton*; a creation narrative is reinterpreted as anguish in *Elohim Creating Adam*. These are “links” in a human communication network.}
