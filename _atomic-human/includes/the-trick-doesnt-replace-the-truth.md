\notes{For the Working Group for the [Royal Society report on Machine Learning](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/machine-learning/publications/machine-learning-report.pdf), back in 2016, the group [worked with Ipsos MORI to engage in public dialogue around the technology](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/machine-learning/publications/public-views-of-machine-learning-ipsos-mori.pdf). Ever since I've been struck about how much more sensible the conversations that emerge from public dialogue are than the breathless drivel that seems to emerge from supposedly more informed individuals.}

\notes{There were a number of messages that emerged from those dialogues, and many of those messages were reinforced in [two further public dialogues we organised in September](https://ai.cam.ac.uk/blog/using-ai-for-public-benefit-insights-from-our-public-dialogues-on-ai-and-the-missions-for-government).}

\notes{However, there was one area we asked about in 2017, but we didn't ask about in 2024. That was an area where the public unequivocal that they didn't want the research community to pursue progress. Quoting from the report (my emphasis).}

\notes{
> **Art**: Participants failed to see the purpose of machine learning-written poetry. For all the other case studies, participants recognised that a machine might be able to do a better job than a human. However, they did not think this would be the case when creating art, as doing so was considered to be a fundamentally human activity *that machines could only mimic at best*.
