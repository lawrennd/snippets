\subsection{From Marconi to AI}
  
\slides{
* Marconi made *communication* wireless and scalable
* AI makes *prediction and decision* scalable
* The question shifts from "can we transmit?" to "what do we transmit *and trust*?"
}
  
\notes{In Bologna, it's hard not to feel the long arc from Marconi's breakthrough to today's AI moment. Wireless did something profound: it separated communication from place.}
  
\notes{AI is doing something similarly profound: it separates *decision-making* from place, and sometimes from the human institutions that normally hold responsibility. It can feel like "intelligence at a distance".}
  
\notes{That's why the right frame isn't magic or sentience, but governance: when do we delegate, when do we supervise, and how do we keep accountability when the system is complex?}
  
\subsection{Security and Creativity}
  
\slides{
* **Security**: where do we place trust when systems act at machine speed?
* **Creativity**: what remains uniquely human when machines can mimic style?
* **Culture** is the interface: institutions, norms, and art shape adoption
}
  
\notes{On the one hand, we have security: not only cyber-security, but epistemic security, how we know what is true when our information is mediated by machines.}
  
\notes{On the other hand, we have emulated creativity. Generative models can produce convincing images and text. But real creativity is also intention, context, responsibility, and lived experience. The atomic human part that doesn’t decompose into patterns alone.}
  
\notes{Digital twins are a great example of the overlap: they are extraordinary creative/engineering achievements, but they also move authority into models, so the key question is *how we keep humans in the loop, and on the hook*.}
