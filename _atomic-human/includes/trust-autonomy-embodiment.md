\subsection{Trust, Autonomy and Embodiment}

\notes{Trust is not a slogan; it is the infrastructure that allows autonomy to be devolved without losing control. Autonomy is always conditional: it depends on what information is available, what incentives shape behaviour, and whether escalation and accountability are real. In executive settings, the practical question is: where do we allow delegation (to people or machines), and where do we insist on human judgement and responsibility?}
