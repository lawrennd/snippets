\subsection{The Attention Reinvestment Cycle}

* AI creates time savings for professionals
* Freed attention reinvested in knowledge sharing
* Organic growth through professional networks

\newslide{Benefits of Organic Growth}

* Solutions spread through peer-to-peer learning
* Frontline workers become technology champions
* Sustainable, scalable implementation

\notes{The attention reinvestment cycle offers a sustainable model for AI adoption. When AI tools save professional time, the key is reinvesting some of that saved attention in sharing knowledge and mentoring colleagues. This allows solutions to spread organically through professional networks.

Unlike top-down implementation, this approach builds momentum through peer-to-peer learning. Frontline workers become both beneficiaries and champions of technology, creating a sustainable cycle of improvement and adoption.

This model has proven particularly effective in healthcare and local government settings, where professional networks are strong and peer learning is already embedded in organizational culture.}
