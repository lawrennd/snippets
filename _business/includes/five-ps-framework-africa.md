\subsection{DSA: The 5 Ps Model in Action}

\slides{
* People first: John Quinn, Ernest Mwebaze, organic networks
* Projects emerged: crop surveillance, malaria prediction
* Purpose crystallized: African-led data science capacity
}

\notes{Data Science Africa demonstrates the 5 Ps framework working in practice. It began with people - John Quinn and Ernest Mwebaze connecting through academic networks, not through formal organizational structures. 

Projects emerged organically: the $100 Android phone for crop surveillance, connecting farmers to Uganda's ministry of agriculture, malaria prediction linking health centres to the ministry of health. These weren't planned as part of a grand strategy - they grew from local needs and practical opportunities.

Purpose crystallized through this work rather than being imposed from outside. The shared vision of African-led data science capacity building emerged from successful collaboration, not from donor mandates or institutional requirements.}

\newslide{Principles from Practice}

\slides{
* "Fundamentals that work" over theoretical ideals
* Local context and cultural alignment
* Avoiding harmful international interventions
}

\notes{DSA's principles developed from experience. The focus on "fundamentals that work" - understanding deployment challenges in people and social environments rather than just mathematics and compute. Emphasis on building with local strengths rather than importing foreign models.

This approach aligns naturally with African cultural practices: Ubuntu philosophy supports the people-first approach, community-based decision making embodies the organic development of purpose and principles, and traditional governance systems often prioritize wisdom over bureaucracy.}

\newslide{Propagating the Model}

\slides{
* The 5 Ps framework emerged from DSA
* Cultural alignment with organic institution building
* Opportunity to scale across the continent
}

\notes{The 5 Ps framework comes from trying to characterise DSA's success over the past decade. Not just for individual intiatives, but for the network itself. This model is now the foundation of how eare are trying to prepare Cambridge and the UK for AI with ai@cam. This shows that rather than trying to replicate Western institutional models, we can build on this demonstrated approach.

The framework allows people to share and  leverage their existing  strengths -  while building institutions capable of competing globally. We have already build a model that others are learning from.

How this progresses is up to you. The strength of the 5 Ps is the purpose can emerge from the people through projects and the process operates in support of that vision.}
