\subsection{The Five Ps Framework}

\slides{
* Purpose: Shared idea around which everything revolves
* People: Convene around purpose
* Projects: Actionable outcomes with individual agreement
}

\notes{The five Ps are: purpose, people, projects, principles, and process. The model is a useful framework for institution building that helps ensure initiatives become institutions that people will rely on.

The first P is purpose, because that's the shared idea around which everything revolves. While people are critical, how do you bring the right people together? People convene around purpose.

But a purpose is often only loosely defined, so it's important to move quickly from the purpose to define projects with actionable outcomes that individual people can agree on. A lofty purpose can be realised in many different ways, but actionable projects force the group to talk about the nitty-gritty about what everyone is trying to achieve and how they're going about it.}

\newslide{Principles and Process}

\slides{
* Principles: Capture what works, guide future directions
* Process: Necessary for sustainability in institutions
* Balance: Keep process and purpose aligned
}

\notes{As projects are developed, we can start to think about principles. These capture what it is about the projects that are working and help in choosing future directions. The principles are specific to the initiative, they characterise how the initiative goes about its work.

The final P is process. Process is necessary for sustainability in an institution. In any long-lived institution it may be easier to understand the process than the purpose. That's because over time institutions evolve to have personalities that are suited to the role they find in society. Such institutions embed their learnings in their processes.

But, for a young agile institution it's important to keep the balance between process and purpose right. Young projects that have placed process ahead of purpose should be avoided, but once the role of an initiative has been understood, developing process is an important part of consolidating the initiative.}
