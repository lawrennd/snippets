\subsection{Supply Chain of Ideas}

\notes{A different way of thinking is a "supply chain of ideas" framework, particularly in the context of information technology and AI solutions like machine learning and large language models. This suggests that this idea flow, from creation to application, is similar to how physical goods move through economic supply chains.}

\slides{* Ideas flow from creation to application like physical supply chains
* Parallels with traditional economic supply chain management
* Particularly relevant for IT and AI solutions}

\notes{In the realm of IT solutions, there's been an overemphasis on macro-economic "supply-side" stimulation - focusing on creating new technologies and ideas - without enough attention to the micro-economic "demand-side" - understanding and addressing real-world needs and challenges.}

\slides{* Current imbalance between supply and demand sides
* Current focus on creating new technologies/companies
* Under-focus on real-world needs}

\notes{Imagining the supply chain rather than just the notion of the Innovation Economy allows the conceptualisation of the gaps between macro and micro economic issues, enabling a different way of thinking about process innovation.}

\notes{Phrasing things in terms of a supply chain of ideas suggests that innovation requires both characterisation of the *demand* and the *supply* of ideas. This leads to four key elements:

1. Multiple sources of ideas (diversity)
2. Efficient delivery mechanisms
3. Quick deployment capabilities
4. Customer-driven prioritization}

\notes{The next priority is mapping the demand for ideas to the supply of ideas. This is where much of our innovation system is failing. In supply chain optimisaiton a large effort is spent on understanding current stock and managing resources to bring the supply to map to the demand. This includes shaping the supply as well as managing it.}

\slides{* Need to map idea demand to supply
* Focus on understanding current "stock" of ideas
* Active management of idea resources
* Shaping supply to meet demand}

\notes{The objective is to create a system that can generate, evaluate, and deploy ideas efficiently and effectively, while ensuring that people's needs and preferences are met. The customer here depends on the context - it could be the public, it could be a business, it could be a government department but very often it's individual citizens. The loss of their voice in the innovation economy is a trigger for the gap between the innovation supply (at a macro level) and the innovation demand (at a micro level).}
