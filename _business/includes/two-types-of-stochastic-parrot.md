\notes{@Bender-parrots21 warned about large language models and suggested that they are operating as *stochastic parrots*. But we are also seeing an increase in hyperbole and uninformed, yet confident comment, from another form of *stochastic parrot*. Those who, like ChatGPT, confidently assert opinion based on hearsay rather than experience. These stochastic parrots are a major challenge for organisations trying to assimilate these technologies.}
