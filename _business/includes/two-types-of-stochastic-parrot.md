\subsection{Two Types of Stochastic Parrot}

\include{_atomic-human/includes/enlightenment-scribeysense.md}

\notes{@Bender-parrots21 was a landmark paper where researchers first raised significant warnings about large language models, characterizing them as *stochastic parrots*. Some of these researchers paid for their bravery with their jobs, and particularly in the UK, their voices and those of other female researchers were largely erased from public debate.}

\notes{Today we see a second type of stochastic parrot emerging: "fleshy GPTs" who speak confidently and eloquently but lack real-world experience. Like the language models they champion, they make arguments that appear superficially convincing but reveal naive flaws to those with deeper domain knowledge. Ironically, some of these voices even claim the research community failed to warn about the implications of these technologies, despite papers like @Bender-parrots21 doing exactly that.}
