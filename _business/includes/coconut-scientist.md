\notes{This is where a "supply chain of ideas" comes in. The infrastructure for taking innovative ideas from their source to where they're required.}

\notes{When Narayan said "supply chain of ideas" I realised that I was a coconut scientist.}

\notes{Most scientists are like the guy sitting beside the river under a coconut palm. Every time someone stopped at the bank, they climb the tree and gave them a coconunt. But my coconut was a scientific solution, my coconuts are machine learning algorithms. You could have any idea you liked, as long as it was a coconut.}

\notes{But in practice, if science is to be translated into something useful then the answers need to be driven by the problems of the real world, this means that the supply chain of ideas needs to be driven by the demand, not the supply. But it should still be driven in that magical way where you're just sailing up the river and all the different scientific ideas are available.}

\notes{Sustained engagement between government and academia plays an important role in building mutual understanding about what each can deliver. Core to Delve's work was the intention that research questions be framed in ways that would resonate with the policy challenges being seen in government.}
