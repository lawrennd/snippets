\section{Superficial Automation}

\notes{The rise of AI has enabled automation of many surface-level tasks - what we might call "superficial automation." These are tasks that appear complex but primarily involve reformatting or restructuring existing information, such as converting bullet points into prose, summarizing documents, or generating routine emails.}

\notes{While such automation can increase immediate productivity, it risks missing the deeper value of these seemingly mundane tasks. For example, the process of composing an email isn't just about converting thoughts into text - it's about:}

\notes{
* Reflection time to properly consider the message
* Building relationships through personal communication
* Developing and refining ideas through the act of writing
* Creating institutional memory through thoughtful documentation
* Projecting corporate culture

* AI enables automation of surface-level tasks
* Examples: Email writing, document summarization
* Risk of losing deeper value in the process

\slides{
* Email writing builds relationships
* Documentation creates institutional memory  
* Human pauses enable reflection

\newslide{The Automation Challenge}
\slides{
* Complex â‰  Complicated
* Speed isn't always progress
* Augment humans, don't replace them

\notes{When we automate these superficial aspects, we can create what appears to be a more efficient process, but one that gradually loses meaning without human involvement. It's like having a meeting transcription without anyone actually attending the meeting - the words are there, but the value isn't.}

\notes{Consider email composition: An AI can convert bullet points into a polished email instantly, but this bypasses the valuable thinking time that comes with composition. The human "pause" in communication isn't inefficiency - it's often where the real value lies.}

\notes{This points to a broader challenge with AI automation: the need to distinguish between tasks that are merely complex (and can be automated) versus those that are genuinely complicated (requiring human judgment and involvement). Effective deployment of AI requires understanding this distinction and preserving the human elements that give business processes their true value.}

\notes{The risk is creating what appears to be a more efficient system but is actually a hollow process - one that moves faster but creates less real value. True digital transformation isn't about removing humans from the loop, but about augmenting human capabilities while preserving the essential human elements that give work its meaning and effectiveness.}

\newslide{Good Process Drives Purpose}

\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/business/liverpool-public-dialogue}{70%}}{Public dialogue held in Liverpool alongside the 2024 Labour Party Conference. The process of discussion is as important as the material discussed. In line with previous dialogues attendees urged us to develop technology where AI operates as a tool for human augmentation, not replacement.}{liverpool-public-dialogue}

\notes{In our public dialogues we saw the same theme: good process can drive purpose. Discussion is as important as the conclusions reached. Attendees urged us to develop technology where AI operates as a tool for human augmentation, not replacement.}
