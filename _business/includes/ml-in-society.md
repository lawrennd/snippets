* Technology implementation vs. cultural transformation
* Balanced approach between automation and augmentation
* The importance of human-centered AI deployment

\notes{When organizations think about deploying ML and AI, there's a tendency to focus primarily on the technology implementation. However, the most successful deployments recognize that this is as much a cultural transformation as it is a technological one.

The question shouldn't be "How do we automate this process?" but rather "How do we empower our people to achieve better outcomes?" This requires a balanced approach that recognizes the unique strengths of both humans and machines.

Humans excel at contextual understanding, ethical judgment, creative problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Machines excel at pattern recognition across vast datasets, consistency, tireless operation, and rapid information processing. The true potential emerges when we design systems that combine these complementary strengths.

For most institutions, this means creating systems that augment human judgment rather than replace it - systems that provide analysts, advisors, and executives with enhanced capabilities while keeping them firmly in control of the decision-making process.

The organisations that will thrive in this new era are those that approach AI deployment with a human-centered mindset, focused on amplifying human capabilities rather than simply automating existing processes.}
