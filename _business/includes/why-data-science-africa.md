\subsection{Why Data Science Africa?}

\notes{I spent September deliverying a four week course on machine learning foundations to colleagues at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri, Kenya. How is this relevant to the Trent mission? From a technological perspective, Africa is very advanced with large band width mobile phone networks. But from a classical infrastructure perspective, and in areas such of health and education there is a lot of work to do. However, this presents a significant opportunity of understanding. I first came to Nyeri 10 years ago, the philosophy of how Data Science Africa works is laid out in a Guardian article from the time.
A large advantage of the African landscape is that new solutions can be imagined using local capabilities and modern technology.

Most of the ideas I worked on in Amazon are inspired by challenges my colleagues experience in the African context, that turn out to also be unresolved challenges for large tech companies such as Amazon.}
