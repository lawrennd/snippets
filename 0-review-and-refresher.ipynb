You first executed some commands to download and explore your data. Then, you used pieces of code to plot and assess the datasets. In the end, you explored some statistical concepts to analyse your data.\n","\n","The problems a data scientist faces and the strategies for their resolution are usually quite similar between domains and datasets. For example, you might want to download different datasets but the API request follows always the same logic. It makes sense then to structure your code in a way it can be reused and you save time. That is one of the technical goals we want you to achieve in this course. To facilitate this, you should use [the Fynesse template](https://github.com/lawrennd/fynesse_template) for structuring your code.\n","\n","The Fynesse template provides a Python template repo for doing data analysis according to the Fynesse framework (Access, Assess, and Address).
