\notes{Trent's security evolution represents a strategic progression from classical security approaches to the new frontier of AI-mediated security challenges. This progression is essential for understanding how security thinking must evolve in the age of AI.

**Phase 1: Classical Security Enhanced with GenAI**

The first phase focuses on using GenAI tools to enhance traditional security approaches. This builds on established security principles while leveraging AI capabilities.

**Key Focus Areas**:
- **Automated threat detection**: Using AI to identify security threats across massive datasets
- **Intelligent response systems**: AI-powered systems that can respond to threats automatically
- **Enhanced monitoring**: AI systems that can monitor security events at machine speed
- **Human-AI collaboration**: Finding the right balance between human oversight and AI execution

**Practical Applications**:
- **Heathrow airport example**: Using AI to predict and prevent infrastructure attacks
- **Security operations centers**: AI-enhanced monitoring and response capabilities
- **Incident response**: AI systems that can analyze and respond to security incidents
- **Threat intelligence**: AI-powered analysis of threat information from multiple sources}

\newslide{Phase 2: GenAI Security}
\slides{
* New attack vectors and defenses
* HAM-specific vulnerabilities
* Indirect prompt injection
* Authority manipulation
}

\notes{**Phase 2: GenAI-Specific Security Challenges**

The second phase addresses the new security challenges that are unique to generative AI systems. This requires fundamentally different approaches to security design.

**Key Focus Areas**:
- **Prompt injection attacks**: Defending against indirect prompt injection and authority manipulation

**Practical Applications**:
- **Notion AI Agents example**: Defending against indirect prompt injection attacks
