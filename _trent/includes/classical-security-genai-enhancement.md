\notes{The Heathrow airport cyber-attack illustrates traditional security challenges that remain relevant even as we enter the AI era. However, GenAI tools offer new opportunities to enhance classical security approaches.

**Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**: The Heathrow attack demonstrates classic infrastructure security problems:
- **Single points of failure**: Critical systems that can bring down entire operations
- **Cascading effects**: Failures that spread across multiple systems and organizations
- **Manual fallback procedures**: The need for human intervention when automated systems fail
- **Response time**: The time it takes to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents

**Human Factors**: Ross Anderson's insight about humans being the weak link remains true:
- **Social engineering**: Attackers exploit human psychology and social dynamics
- **Error-prone behavior**: Humans make mistakes, especially under pressure
- **Limited attention**: Security monitoring requires constant vigilance
- **Trust and authority**: Humans are susceptible to manipulation}
