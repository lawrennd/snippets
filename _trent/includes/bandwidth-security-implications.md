\subsection{Bandwidth and Security}

\notes{The fundamental challenge in AI security stems from the bandwidth mismatch between humans and digital systems.

Humans process information at approximately 30 bits per second. Machines can process at billions of bits per second.

- **Security monitoring**: We can't process the volume of security events generated by modern systems
- **Threat detection**: Attack patterns emerge across massive datasets that exceed human processing capacity
- **Incident response**: Security incidents unfold at machine speed, faster than human decision-making
- **Policy enforcement**: Security policies must be implemented at scale beyond human oversight}

\newslide{Agility/Scale}

\slides{* There is a need to act quickly.
* But a need to react decisevely.
* Creates an agility/scale problem.}

\notes{There's an agility/scale problem when it comes to need to react quickly vs the capaibility to react decisively.}

\notes{In contrast, digital systems operate at millions of bits per second. This creates an information asymmetry}


\newslide{Security Implications}
\slides{
* Oversight gap: humans cannot monitor AI systems
* Speed mismatch: incidents unfold faster than human response
* Scale mismatch: AI systems exceed human understanding
* Trust and verification become impossible
}

\notes{This bandwidth mismatch creates and exacerbates security challenges:

**Oversight Gap**: Humans cannot effectively monitor AI systems operating at their full capacity. This creates blind spots where malicious activities can occur undetected.

**Speed Mismatch**: Security incidents unfold faster than human response times. By the time humans detect and respond to threats, the damage may already be done.

**Scale Mismatch**: AI systems can process information at scales that exceed human understanding. This makes it difficult to predict or control their behavior.

**Trust and Verification**: The bandwidth mismatch makes it impossible for humans to verify that AI systems are operating as intended. We must trust systems we cannot fully understand or monitor.}

\subsection{Fighting Fire with Fire}

\slides{* Well deployed these technologies can help.
* Large companies lack agility.
* Small businesses don't have the technical expertise.
* Trent.AI bringing expertise to bear on the real problems}
