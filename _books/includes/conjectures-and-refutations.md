\notes{In "Conjectures and Refutations" [@Popper-conjectures63], Popper elaborates on his philosophy of science, arguing that scientific knowledge progresses through bold conjectures that are then subjected to rigorous attempts at refutation. He contrasts this with verification-based approaches, arguing that no amount of confirmatory evidence can prove a universal theory, but a single counter-example can disprove it.}

\notes{This philosophy of falsificationism suggests that scientists should actively try to disprove their theories rather than seek confirming evidence. For Popper, what makes a theory scientific is not its ability to be verified, but its ability to be falsified - it must make predictions that could potentially be proven wrong.}

\notes{These ideas have profound implications for how we understand scientific progress and the scientific method. It implies science isn't an activity of individuals, it is necessarily a community effort. }
