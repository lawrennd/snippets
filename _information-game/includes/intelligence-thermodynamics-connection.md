\section{Intelligence as an Energy-Efficient Process}

\notes{When we view intelligence through the lens of thermodynamics some parallels emerge. Both systems appear to be governed by similar principles of energy efficiency and entropy management.}

\subsection{Measurement as a Thermodynamic Process}

\notes{Observations or measurements made by a system can be understood as a thermodynamic process. Taking a measurement requires energy and produces heat - whether in biological systems or silicon computers. The act of observing itself modifies the energy landscape of the system. While in theory computation is reversible in practice it involves entropy production for error correction.}

\slides{
* Observation requires energy expenditure
* Landauer's principle: erasing information costs energy
* Measurement precision limited by energy availability
* Quantum limit: $\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \hbar/2$

\subsection{Model Approximations and Thermodynamic Efficiency}

\notes{Intelligent systems balance model complexity against energy efficiency and time requirements. A perfect model of the world would require infinite computational resources and speed, so in practice approximations are necessary. This leads to uncertainties. Thermodynamics can be seen as the physics of uncertainty: at equilibrium thermodynamic systems find thermodynamic states that minimize free energy, equivalent to maximising entropy.}

\slides{
* Perfect models require infinite resources
* Approximations minimize free energy
* Bounded rationality as thermodynamic constraint
* Intelligence optimized for energy efficiency, not accuracy
}

\notes{We might view cognitive biases and heuristics as attempts at thermodynamically efficient approximations - they sacrifice some accuracy but dramatically reduce computational (and thus energy) requirements. This would suggest that intelligence doesn't find perfect solutions but energetically efficient ones.}

\subsection{Intelligence as a State-Change Process}

\notes{Perpetual motion is impossible, there is no 'artificial general vehicle', different vehicles make different compromises in their physics to adapt to the context. Similarly, different intelligences need to adapt to their circumstances to efficiently changes states in a system. This adaptation involes modifying internal configurations to better match environmental patterns, a process we can think of as learning. This parallels how physical systems reconfigure to minimise free energy.}

\notes{It might seem that the key difference is that intelligent systems do this proactively and with purpose, but free energy minimisation also has a teleological quality to it. This is perhaps most notable in the principle of least action}

\notes{
> The idea of causality, that it goes from one point to another, and another, and so on, is easy to understand. But the principle of least time is a completely different philosophical principle about the way nature works. Instead of saying it is a causal thing, that when we do one thing, some thing else happens, and so on, it says this: we set up the situation, and light decides which is the shortest time, or the extreme one, and chooses that path. But what does it do, how does it find out? Does it smell the nearby paths, and check them against each other?

\notes{This first attempt to understand intelligence thermodynamically suggests that intelligent systems are they traversing energy landscapes in ways that minimize thermodynamic costs while maximizing useful work.}
