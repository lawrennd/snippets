\section{The Entropy Game}

\notes{The Entropy Game provides a powerful framework for understanding intelligence as a process of efficient uncertainty reduction. In its simplest form, we can think of it as finding the optimal strategy for identifying an unknown entity by asking the minimum number of yes/no questions.}

\slides{
* Intelligence as optimal uncertainty reduction
* 20 Questions game as intuitive example
* Binary search exemplifies optimal strategy
* Information gain measures question quality
}

\subsection{The 20 Questions Paradigm}

\notes{Consider the classic game of 20 Questions, where one player thinks of an object and the other must identify it by asking at most 20 yes/no questions. The optimal strategy isn't to ask random questions but to strategically divide the possibility space in half with each question. This binary search approach ensures maximum information gain with each inquiry.}

\subsection{Entropy Reduction as Intelligence}

\notes{From an information-theoretic perspective, intelligence can be viewed as the capacity to efficiently reduce entropy - the uncertainty about the state of the world. Each observation or action an intelligent agent takes should maximize expected information gain, optimally reducing uncertainty given available resources.}

\slides{
* Entropy before question: $H(X)$
* Entropy after answer: $H(X|A)$
* Information gain: $I(X;A) = H(X) - H(X|A)$
* Intelligent systems maximize $I(X;A)$ per unit cost
}

\notes{This framework helps explain why both biological and artificial intelligence systems appear to behave as if they're performing active inference - constantly generating predictions and updating models to minimize surprise and uncertainty. The entropy game reveals intelligence as a process of efficiently navigating information landscapes.}

\subsection{Thermodynamic Parallels}

\notes{The entropy game connects to thermodynamics through the concept of work. In thermodynamics, extracting work from a system requires reducing its entropy. Similarly, meaningful intelligent action requires reducing uncertainty about the environment. Both processes can be understood as converting free energy into useful work - whether physical work or informational value.}

\slides{
* Intelligence requires work to reduce uncertainty
* Thermodynamic work reduces physical entropy
* Both operate under resource constraints
* Both bound by fundamental efficiency limits
}

\notes{This perspective suggests a profound connection: intelligence might be understood as a special case of systems that efficiently extract, process, and utilize free energy from their environments, with thermodynamic principles setting fundamental constraints on what's possible.}
