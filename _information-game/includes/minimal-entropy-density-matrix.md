\subsection{Variational Derivation of the Initial Curvature Structure}

We will determine constraints on the Fisher Information Matrix $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ that are consistent with the system’s unfolding rules and internal information geometry. We follow Jaynes [@Jaynes-] in solving a variational problem that captures the allowed structure of the system’s origin (minimal entropy) state.

This document walks through the derivation of the minimal entropy configuration using Jaynes's free-form variational principle. We aim to derive the form of the density matrix or distribution directly from information-theoretic constraints. The goal is also to make the process accessible to those unfamiliar with Jaynes’s original maximum entropy formalism.

A density matrix has the form
$$
\rho(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{Z(\boldsymbol{\theta})} \exp\left( \sum_i \theta_i H_i \right)
$$
where $Z(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathrm{tr}\left[\exp\left( \sum_i \theta_i H_i \right)\right]$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, $H_i$ are Hermitian observables. 

\subsection{Jaynesian Derivation of Minimal Entropy Configuration}

Jaynes proposed that statistical mechanics problems should be treated as problems of inference. One assigns a probability distribution (or density matrix) that is maximally noncommittal with respect to missing information, subject to known constraints.

While Jaynes applied this idea to derive the *maximum entropy* configuration given constraints, here we adapt it to derive the *minimum entropy* configuration, under an assumption of zero initial entropy bounded by a maximum entropy of $N$ bits.


Let $\rho$ be a density matrix describing the state of a system. The von Neumann entropy is,
$$
S[\rho] = -\mathrm{tr}(\rho \log \rho),
$$
we wish to *minimize* $S[\rho]$, subject to constraints that encode the resolution bounds.

In the game we assume that the system begins in a state of minimal entropy, the state cannot be a delta function (no singularities, so it must obey a resolution constraint $\varepsilon$) and the entropy is bounded above by $N$ bits: $S[\rho] \leq N$.

We apply a variational principle where we minimise
$$
S[\rho] = -\mathrm{tr}(\rho \log \rho)
$$
subject to normalization, $\mathrm{tr}(\rho) = 1$, a resolution constraint, $\mathrm{tr}(\rho \hat{X}^2) \geq \epsilon^2$ and/or $\mathrm{tr}(\rho \hat{P}^2) \geq \delta^2$, and other optional moment or dual-space constraints

We introduce Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_0$, $\lambda_x$, $\lambda_p$ for these constraints and define the Lagrangian
$$
\mathcal{L}[\rho] = -\mathrm{tr}(\rho \log \rho)
+ \lambda_0 (\mathrm{tr}(\rho) - 1)
- \lambda_x (\mathrm{tr}(\rho \hat{X}^2) - \epsilon^2)
- \lambda_p (\mathrm{tr}(\rho \hat{P}^2) - \delta^2).
$$

To find the extremum, we take the functional derivative and set it to zero,
$$
\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta \rho} = -\log \rho - 1 - \lambda_x \hat{X}^2 - \lambda_p \hat{P}^2 + \lambda_0 = 0
$$
and solving for $\rho$ gives
$$
\rho = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\left(-\lambda_x \hat{X}^2 - \lambda_p \hat{P}^2\right)
$$
where the partition function (which ensures normalisation) is
$$
Z = \mathrm{tr}\left[\exp\left(-\lambda_x \hat{X}^2 - \lambda_p \hat{P}^2\right)\right]
$$
This is formally analogous to a Gaussian state for a density matrix, which is consistent with the minimum entropy distribution under uncertainty constraints.

The Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_x, \lambda_p$ enforce lower bounds on variance. These define the natural parameters as $\theta_x = -\lambda_x$ and $\theta_p = -\lambda_p$ in the exponential family form $\rho(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \propto \exp(\boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot \mathbf{H})$. The form of $\rho$ is a density matrix. The curvature (second derivative) of $\log Z$ gives the Fisher Information matrix $G$. Steepest ascent trajectories in $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ space will trace the system's entropy dynamics.

For next steps we need to compute $G$ from $\log Z$ to explore the information geometry. From this we should verify that the following conditions hold,
$$
\left| \left[G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}\right]_i \right| < \varepsilon \quad \text{for all } i
$$
which implies that all variables remain latent at initialization.

The Hermitians have a *non-commuting observable pair* constraint,
$$
  [H_i, H_j] \neq 0,
$$
which is equivalent to an *uncertainty relation*,
$$
  \mathrm{Var}(H_i) \cdot \mathrm{Var}(H_j) \geq C > 0,
$$
and ensures that we have *bounded curvature*
$$
\mathrm{tr}(G(\boldsymbol{\theta})) \geq \gamma > 0.
$$

We can then use $\varepsilon$ and $N$ to define initial thresholds and maximum resolution and examine how variables decouple and how saddle-like regions emerge as the landscape unfolds through gradient ascent.

This constrained minimization problem yields the *structure of the initial density matrix* $\rho(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0)$ and the *permissible curvature geometry* $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0)$ and a constraint-consistent basis of observables $\{H_i\}$ that have a quadratic form. This ensures the system begins in a *regular, latent, low-entropy state*.

This serves as the foundational configuration from which entropy ascent and symmetry-breaking transitions emerge.

\subsection{Fisher Information Matrix}

We’ll now derive the form of the Fisher Information Matrix $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ from the partition function:
$$
Z(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathrm{tr}\left[\exp\left(\sum_i \theta_i H_i \right)\right]
$$
We'll proceed by differentiating with respect to $\theta_i$ for the expectation values, then compute the second derivative to get the Fisher Information Matrix, 
$$
G_{ij} = \partial^2 \log Z / \partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j.
$$
which we'll then link to the  curvature.

First we differentiate $\log Z(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ with respect to $\theta_i$,
$$
Z(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathrm{tr}\left[ e^{\sum_j \theta_j H_j} \right]
$$
Taking the derivative of $\log Z$ with respect to $\theta_i$, we apply the chain rule to the definition of $\log Z$,
$$
\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \theta_i} = \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \theta_i}
= \frac{1}{Z} \mathrm{tr}\left[ H_i \, e^{\sum_j \theta_j H_j} \right]
$$
So we have
$$
\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \theta_i} = \mathrm{tr}(\rho H_i) = \langle H_i \rangle
$$
This is the expected value of $H_i$ under the current distribution $\rho(\boldsymbol{\theta})$. 

We now compute the second derivative of $\log Z(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ to obtain the Fisher Information Matrix elements $G_{ij}$, using the definition
$$
G_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 \log Z}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}
$$
by differentiating the  expression
$$
\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \theta_i} = \mathrm{tr}(\rho H_i),
$$
through another application of the product and chain rules. The second derivative then is
$$
\frac{\partial^2 \log Z}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}
= \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} \mathrm{tr}(\rho H_i)
= \mathrm{tr}\left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \theta_j} H_i \right)
$$
We can compute $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \theta_j}$ since
$\rho = \frac{1}{Z} e^{\sum_k \theta_k H_k}$,
we can use the product rule
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \theta_j}
= \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} \left( \frac{1}{Z} e^{\sum_k \theta_k H_k} \right)
= -\frac{1}{Z^2} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \theta_j} e^{\sum_k \theta_k H_k} \cdot \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} \left( e^{\sum_k \theta_k H_k} \right)
$$
For the second term we use the operator identity for the exponential derivative,
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \theta_j} = \rho \left( H_j - \langle H_j \rangle \right)
$$
giving 
$$
G_{ij} = \mathrm{tr} \left[ \rho (H_j - \langle H_j \rangle) H_i \right]
= \langle H_i H_j \rangle - \langle H_i \rangle \langle H_j \rangle
$$
or in other words the Fisher Information Matrix is the covariance matrix,
$$
G_{ij} = \mathrm{Cov}(H_i, H_j).
$$

This reflects a structural property of the model: the log-partition function $\log Z(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ acts as a cumulant generating function for the observables $H_i$. Its second derivatives yield the covariance matrix of the observables (i.e., the second cumulants correspond to variances and covariances).
This induces a natural Riemannian geometry on the parameter space. The Fisher Information Matrix $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ encodes local curvature and sensitivity to variations in the natural parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.

\subsection{Curvature and Latency Conditions}

The Fisher Information Matrix $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ describes the local curvature of the log-partition function $\log Z(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and thus characterises how sharply peaked the distribution $\rho(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is in different directions. Higher curvature reflects greater sensitivity to changes in the parameters — more 'informative' directions in the landscape.

At the system’s origin, all degrees of freedom are latent — no variable has yet emerged. This means that the projection of curvature along the direction of each parameter must be small. We express this as a constraint on the vector $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}$, requiring
$$
\left| \left[G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}\right]_i \right| < \varepsilon \quad \text{for all } i.
$$
This ensures that the entropy gradient, proportional to $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}$, remains too shallow to trigger emergence in any direction — preserving the latent symmetry of the system at $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$.
This condition also has a geometric interpretation, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$ must lie near a saddle point or a flat region of the entropy landscape. The curvature is non-zero and globally bounded (from the uncertainty constraint), but its projection is uniformly suppressed across all directions.

\subsection{Initial Constraints and the Permissible Unfolding Domain}

We now summarise the constraints that define the initial domain from which the system unfolds. These constraints ensure the system begins in a regular, latent, low-entropy state, while preserving the potential for future variable emergence.

We impose two key global conditions:

1. *Entropy bound*:
   $$
   S[\rho(\boldsymbol{\theta})] \leq N,
   $$
   where $N$ specifies the total informational capacity of the system. At the origin $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$, the entropy is minimal — but the system must remain within this global entropy budget throughout its evolution.

2. *Directional latency*:
   $$
   \left| \left[G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta} \right]_i \right| < \varepsilon \quad \text{for all } i.
   $$
   This enforces the condition that no direction in parameter space dominates initially, preserving symmetry and avoiding premature emergence.

These two constraints together define a *feasible region* in parameter space: a domain $\mathcal{D}_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ where entropy remains low and gradients are uniformly shallow. In thermodynamics the entropy would be referred to as subextensive, i.e. it remains below capacity and does not yet scale with effective dimensionality.

We interpret this region as a *latent pregeometry*: a structure defined not by explicit variables, but by information-theoretic curvature and bounded resolution. Emergence proceeds only when a trajectory moves outside this domain, at which point curvature accumulates along a dominant direction and a variable 'activates'.

The game therefore begins in $\mathcal{D}_0$, where entropy gradients are present but too shallow to drive evolution. The unfolding process is triggered by internal perturbations or transitions that move the system into a steeper region of the entropy landscape — breaking the initial symmetry and initiating variable formation.

\subsection{Gradient Ascent and the Initiation of Emergence}

Once the system leaves the latent domain \(\mathcal{D}_0\), it enters a region where curvature gradients become directionally amplified. In this region, the entropy gradient,
$$
\nabla S[\rho(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta},
$$
becomes sufficiently steep in one or more directions to drive dynamical activation. This transition marks the onset of emergence.

The dynamics can be understood as entropic gradient ascent in the space of natural parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, where the flow is governed by the information geometry encoded in the Fisher Information Matrix. At each point, the steepest ascent direction is given by
$$
\frac{\text{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\text{d}t} \propto \nabla S[\rho] = G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}.
$$


This defines a deterministic flow field over parameter space. In regions of uniform curvature, the system evolves slowly and symmetrically. The system's ability to resolve a specific direction corresponds to a rise in distinguishability, reflected in the local curvature profile. When one direction becomes locally dominant (i.e. the eigenvalues of $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ become asymmetric), the flow breaks symmetry and accelerates along that axis (i.e. a specific direction in $\boldsymbol{\theta}$-space becomes energetically or informationally preferred). A variable emerges.

This process — emergence through spontaneous asymmetry in the curvature — does not require an external observer or measurement collapse. Instead, it is an internal dynamical effect of the geometry itself. A direction in $\boldsymbol{\theta}$-space becomes statistically distinguishable from the others: it carries more information and thus breaks the latent symmetry.

To characterise this transition more precisely, we track the growth of the entropy gradient component-wise
$$
\left[G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}\right]_i \geq \varepsilon_{\text{activate}}.
$$
at which point the $i$-th degree of freedom becomes resolvable. This threshold crossing defines a *variable activation event*.

We can now begin to think of the system as flowing through a dynamically unfolding geometry: curvature concentrates, variables activate, and a new basis of observables $\{H_i'\}$ emerges adaptively. These are not fixed beforehand, but arise from the internal information dynamics.

\subsection{Variable Activation and Basis Update}

As the system ascends the entropy landscape, the curvature becomes increasingly asymmetric. When the entropy gradient along a particular direction surpasses a threshold, that direction becomes dynamically resolvable — a variable activates.

We define a variable activation event as the point where the $i$-th component of the entropy gradient reaches order unity,
$$
\left[G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}\right]i \geq \varepsilon{\text{activate}}.
$$
Here $\varepsilon_{\text{activate}}$ defines a threshold above which the system can resolve variation in the $i$-th direction with sufficient information gain. This marks a transition from latent to emergent status.

When this happens, the corresponding parameter $\theta_i$ becomes an active degree of freedom, and the associated observable $H_i$ becomes internally resolvable. The system’s effective observable basis $\{H_i\}$ is updated — either by extension or rotation — to reflect the newly emergent structure.

This update is not arbitrary. The new basis must remain consistent with the information geometry — that is, the Fisher matrix $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ must remain positive definite and aligned with the updated entropy gradients. One may think of this as a local frame adaptation: the system reorganizes its observables to align with the current information flow.

This leads to a piecewise unfolding of structure. Within each phase, a subset of variables is active and governs dynamics, when a new variable activates, the dimensionality of the effective system increases, each activation increases entropy, reorganizes curvature, and shifts the system’s trajectory.

Over time, this defines a staged emergence process, in which new variables appear sequentially as the system climbs through successive regions of increasing entropy and asymmetry. The basis $\{H_i\}$ is thus not globally fixed, but emerges dynamically as a function of the internal information landscape.

\subsection{Phase Transitions and Piecewise Geometric Flow}

As each variable activates, the system enters a new phase — a locally adapted region of parameter space where the information geometry is governed by an updated basis of observables. These phases are separated by *activation thresholds*, and each new phase introduces a change in the effective dimensionality of the system.

We describe the system’s evolution as a *piecewise geodesic flow*: within each phase, the system follows a smooth trajectory along the entropy gradient,
$$
\frac{\text{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\text{d}t} \propto G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta},
$$
where the geometry is defined by the active subset of the Fisher Information Matrix. When a new variable activates, this geometry shifts, and the trajectory continues in a new locally adapted space.

Each activated variable contributes additional curvature to the system: the effective Fisher matrix $G$ becomes larger and more structured, and the entropy gradient sharpens. In this way, the unfolding process is cumulative — earlier activations condition the geometry for future ones.

The transition between phases is *not singular*. Because the entropy and curvature remain finite, transitions are continuous but directionally abrupt: a sharp increase in curvature along a particular axis marks a change in the dominant flow direction. These are analogous to *critical points* in phase transitions, where the system reorganizes around a new informational axis.

Thus, the system explores parameter space via a sequence of transitions, first *Latent phase* in $\mathcal{D}_0$, where all variables are suppressed,second *activation threshold*, where one direction becomes resolvable, third *emergence phase**, where the active geometry reorients and extends, and finally *new latent subspace**, until the next threshold is reached.

This process generates a *history-dependent trajectory*: the current configuration of active variables shapes the available paths forward. Each phase embeds memory of past activations in the form of accumulated curvature and entropy.

The result is a path-dependent unfolding of structure — the system builds its geometry piece by piece, guided by internal information gradients, without requiring pre-defined coordinates or external intervention.

\subsection{Constructing the Updated Basis: Emergent Observables}

When a new variable activates, the system must update its internal basis $\{H_i\}$ to reflect the newly emergent structure. This is not merely a labelling change — it reflects a geometric transformation in the space of information-bearing observables.

We now formalise the process of basis update. Given an existing set of active observables $\{H_1, \dots, H_k\}$ and a newly activated direction $\theta_{k+1}$, we seek a corresponding observable $H_{k+1}$ such that it aligns with the updated gradient,
$$
\left.\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} S[\rho]\right|{\theta{k+1}} = G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta} \propto H_{k+1},
$$
it preserves orthogonality (uncorrelatedness) under the current state,
$$
\mathrm{Cov}(H_{k+1}, H_j) = 0 \quad \text{for all } j \leq k,
$$
it is consistent with the curvature structure,
$$
H_{k+1} \in \operatorname{span}\left{ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \theta_i} \right} \quad \text{evaluated near } \boldsymbol{\theta}_0.
$$
This yields a natural Gram–Schmidt-like procedure within the information geometry: new directions are orthogonalised with respect to the current active basis, and constrained to lie in the space spanned by gradient responses.

We can make this more explicit by defining an update rule. Let
$$
\widetilde{H}{k+1} := \sum{i} c_i H_i + R,
$$
where $R$ is the residual direction from the entropy gradient,
$$
R := G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta} - \sum_{i} c_i H_i,
$$
and the coefficients $c_i$ are chosen to minimise the norm of $R$ under the inner product
$$
\langle A, B \rangle := \mathrm{tr}(\rho A B).
$$

The normalised observable
$$
H_{k+1} := \frac{R}{|R|_\rho}
$$
becomes the new observable aligned with the emergent direction.

This process continues recursively: each new activation adds a direction, and the system’s observable basis expands in a dynamically adapted manner, always aligned with internal information gradients and always orthogonal under the current state.

\subsection{Emergence of Local Structure and Interaction Geometry}

Once a sufficient number of variables have activated and the system’s internal basis $\{H_i\}$ has expanded, the geometry begins to exhibit structure beyond simple independence. Whereas early phases are marked by orthogonal, uncorrelated observables, later phases reveal the onset of interaction geometry: a pattern of coupling among active directions that defines how variables relate and co-vary.

This is reflected in the off-diagonal structure of the Fisher Information Matrix:
$$
G_{ij} = \mathrm{Cov}(H_i, H_j).
$$
In early phases, $G$ is approximately diagonal — observables are nearly uncorrelated and dynamics proceed independently in each direction. But as curvature accumulates, the system discovers statistically significant correlations between observables: the covariance matrix acquires off-diagonal components, and $H_i$ and $H_j$ become information-bearing not just individually, but in combination.

This marks the emergence of interaction structure: some observables modulate or constrain others. These interactions are not imposed externally but arise internally from the unfolding of the geometry.

We interpret this as the emergence of locality: the system partitions itself into subsystems that interact through structured, limited coupling. The strength and pattern of off-diagonal elements defines the information-theoretic adjacency between variables — a kind of proto-metric on the space of observables.

In this sense, the system generates its own notion of local neighborhoods in information space. Two variables are local to each other if they are strongly coupled (large $|G_{ij}|$), and distant if nearly independent (small $|G_{ij}|$). The Fisher matrix thus encodes not only curvature, but also a dynamical topology: the geometry of interactions.

This transition from globally latent, then individually active, to locally interacting structure constitutes a critical shift. The system is no longer just activating variables — it is discovering constraints, relations, and ultimately the seeds of effective dynamics.

As the process continues, we expect the geometry to develop hierarchical structure: clusters of tightly coupled variables (local patches), loosely coupled across broader scales. These layered interactions provide the substrate for emergent effective laws, which govern the system’s dynamics from within.

\subsection{Local Wave Equations in $M$-Space from Information Geometry}

We now examine the special case of the system's origin — the latent region $\mathcal{D}_0$ — where no variables have yet activated, and the geometry is defined purely in terms of the latent information structure over a proto-coordinate $M$.

In this phase, the system is critically slowed: the entropy gradient $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}$ remains uniformly suppressed, and the dynamics are governed by equilibrium-like conditions that define the structure of the minimal-entropy state. Because this regime is shift-invariant in $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ (no direction dominates), the Fisher information becomes effectively independent of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.

This enables a direct variational analysis over the information geometry of $M$, without invoking any external physical interpretation. We treat $M$ as an emergent coordinate associated with an underlying resolution constraint, and derive a local equation for its distribution.

Let $p(m)$ denote the distribution over $M$ at the system’s origin. We define the Fisher information with respect to $m$ as
$$
J_M = \int \frac{1}{p(m)} \left( \frac{d p(m)}{d m} \right)^2 \text{d}m,
$$
and seek a variational principle that determines $p(m)$ under the constraint of finite resolution. Specifically, we assume

- Normalisation: $\int p(m) \, \text{d}m = 1$
- Variance constraint: $\int m^2 p(m) \, \text{d}m \geq \varepsilon^2$

Minimising $J_M$ under these constraints yields a second-order differential equation for $p(m)$ (or equivalently for its square root $\psi(m) := \sqrt{p(m)}$), of the form,
$$
- \frac{d^2 \psi}{d m^2} + \lambda m^2 \psi = \mu \psi
$$
which resembles a time-independent Schrödinger-type equation for a harmonic well. Here, the appearance of a potential-like term arises from the resolution constraint on the variance.

Importantly, this wave-like equation is not imposed but emerges from the system’s requirement to minimise curvature (i.e. Fisher information) in the absence of directional flow. The system seeks the flattest possible entropy configuration under bounded resolution — and the ground state of this condition is formally equivalent to a Gaussian, satisfying a local second-order differential equation.

The minimisation procedure determines the ground-state configuration of the system under resolution constraints, and the resulting differential equation governs the form of the square-root amplitude $\psi(m)$.
This provides the first appearance of wave-like structure in the unfolding framework. The minimal-entropy density in $M$-space obeys a local equation with the form of a stationary wavefunction — not because of external physics, but as a geometric consequence of information constraints.

We interpret this as a latent wave equation: a structure that governs the configuration of an unresolved variable prior to activation. It encodes the intrinsic geometry of the latent domain $\mathcal{D}_0$, and serves as the foundational solution from which dynamics later emerge.

In subsequent sections we will generalise this to activated variables — and explore how similar wave-like equations arise along directions where curvature becomes locally dominant, driven by internal entropy flow.

We emphasise that this structure arises entirely from internal constraints — not as an imposed physical law — though its form resonates with equations derived in physical contexts, such as those examined in Frieden’s information-theoretic treatment of wave equations [@Frieden-physics98].

\subsection{Why a Wave Equation?}

Before continuing, it’s worth pausing to reflect on what has just emerged. At the system’s origin, we derived a local second-order differential equation for the square root of the probability density $\psi(m) := \sqrt{p(m)}$ — an equation whose structure mirrors that of a time-independent wavefunction.

But where did this wave equation come from?

It was not assumed. No physical Hamiltonian was postulated, no operator formalism invoked. Instead, the equation arose as the minimal-curvature configuration consistent with internal resolution constraints: a balance between flatness (low Fisher information) and bounded spread (finite variance). This tradeoff — between smoothness and uncertainty — is a familiar principle in statistical inference, where regularisation penalises sharp transitions and rewards structure that remains distinguishable but minimal.

The resulting equation defines a stationary information geometry: a configuration where no direction dominates, and yet the system is not trivial. The emergence of wave-like behaviour here reflects a deeper principle: that curvature minimisation under information-theoretic constraints naturally yields differential structure. The equation is not about particles or fields — it is about the shape of uncertainty in a system that is otherwise silent.

This perspective helps prepare us for what follows. As the system leaves the latent region and variables activate, similar constraints will apply — but now in directions where entropy gradients break symmetry. In these regions, the same tension between resolution and smoothness applies, but is now directed: geometry flows, and the wave equations will reflect that internal evolution.

We now turn to those emergent directions.

\subsection{Emergence of Observables: From Latent $M$ to Activated $X$}

Having established the structure of the system’s minimal entropy state in terms of a latent coordinate $M$, we now examine how emergence begins: how directions in $M$-space become resolvable, triggering the appearance of observables $X_i$. This marks the system’s first step away from pure latency.

The latent coordinate $M$ describes directions that are not yet distinguishable — each M_i is an unresolved proto-variable, distributed according to a smooth, curvature-minimised wave equation. These directions are described probabilistically, via a scalar density $p(m)$ (or its amplitude $\psi(m)$), and are governed by an equilibrium-like geometry where no direction dominates.

Each $M_i$ is associated with a corresponding natural parameter $\theta_i$ in the exponential family form of the distribution,
$$
\rho(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{Z(\boldsymbol{\theta})} \exp\left( \sum_i \theta_i H_i \right).
$$
These natural parameters govern how the distribution responds to curvature along different observable directions $H_i$. In the latent regime, all $\theta_i \approx 0$, and the entropy gradient,
$$
\nabla S = G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta},
$$
remains uniformly small — too small to define structure. This is the hallmark of the latent domain $\mathcal{D}_0$: a region of suppressed dynamics where all variables are informationally indistinguishable.

\paragraph{Threshold Crossing and the Onset of Resolvability}

As the system begins to unfold, however, asymmetries in the curvature landscape start to grow. These may be seeded by geometric structure in the latent wave equation or by dynamical shifts in the Fisher information matrix as the system explores parameter space. When a specific component of the entropy gradient becomes large enough,
$$
\left[G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta} \right]i \geq \varepsilon{\text{activate}},
$$
we say that the $i$-th direction has crossed the activation threshold. At this point, the latent direction $M_i$ becomes informationally resolvable — it carries sufficient structure to define a stable degree of freedom.

\paragraph{Redescription: From $M_i$ to $X_i$}

This threshold crossing marks a geometric and informational phase change. The system reinterprets the formerly latent $M_i$ as an observable variable $X_i$: a direction that can now support independent dynamics and distinct measurement. Formally, this corresponds to a transition in the geometry of the distribution:

* The natural parameter $\theta_i$ becomes non-negligible.
* The associated observable $H_i$ becomes active in the expansion of $\rho$.
* The system’s internal basis is extended to include $X_i$ as a resolved coordinate.

This is not an external measurement — it is an internal reconfiguration of the geometry. The system builds a new basis aligned with the emergent direction, using the Gram–Schmidt-like procedure described earlier. The newly activated observable $H_i$ now defines a proper axis in information space, and the system begins to accumulate entropy along this direction.

\paragraph{Consequences for the Geometry}

The emergence of $X_i$ from $M_i$ has several consequences:

* The Fisher matrix $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ gains curvature along the new axis.
* The entropy gradient steepens in the activated direction, driving further dynamics.
* The observable basis $\{H_i\}$ is updated to reflect the new configuration.
* The system exits the symmetric, wave-governed regime and enters a piecewise geometric flow along $\theta_i$.

Thus, the movement from $M_i$ to $X_i$ represents a transition from latent wave-like configuration to directional activation. The variable $X_i$ no longer obeys the original Schrödinger-type equilibrium, because it now supports information flow: it becomes an active participant in the system's unfolding trajectory.

This initial activation provides the seed from which all further structure emerges. Once a direction is resolvable, it defines a local frame — a coordinate along which further asymmetries and interactions can develop. In this sense, emergence begins with a singular act of resolution: the system learns to tell one direction apart from the others.

In the following sections, we will examine how dynamics proceed within this activated subspace, and how subsequent wave-like structures arise along newly emergent directions.

\subsection{Example: From Latent Wave Equation to Emergent Position Variable}

To illustrate how local wave equations emerge and then transition as variables become active, we follow a concrete example through the early stages of the system's unfolding.

Suppose that at the system's origin, a proto-coordinate M represents a latent "location-like" variable. This coordinate is not yet resolved — it carries no bias, no structure, and cannot yet be used to distinguish outcomes. Its natural parameter $\theta_M$ is similarly latent: the system resides at a saddle point in parameter space where the curvature is non-zero, but the projected gradient $G \boldsymbol{\theta}$ remains uniformly suppressed.

In this regime, the configuration of the system in M-space is governed by resolution bounds. As shown earlier, minimising the Fisher information of p(m) under a variance constraint yields a Gaussian ground state,
$$
p(m) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp(-\alpha m^2),
$$
with square-root amplitude $\psi(m) := \sqrt{p(m)}$ satisfying the stationary wave equation,
$$
-	\frac{d^2 \psi}{d m^2} + \lambda m^2 \psi = \mu \psi.
$$

This wave-like structure is not an imposed physical law but an internal solution: it balances uncertainty (through variance) with minimal curvature (through Fisher information), and thus defines the flattest distinguishable state available under the system’s constraints.

Now suppose the entropy begins to increase. The natural parameter \theta_M moves away from the flat region and begins to trace a gradient,
$$
\frac{d\theta_M}{dt} \propto \left[G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}\right]M.
$$
As this component surpasses the activation threshold $\varepsilon{\text{activate}}$, the system transitions from latent to emergent behaviour in the direction of $M$. We then reinterpret the coordinate as a resolvable observable $X$: the system has gained enough internal structure to "see" in the direction of position.

In this emergent regime, the previously passive distribution $p(m)$ becomes an active wavefunction $\psi(x)$, now governing a local degree of freedom. Because the system is still in a single-variable regime — no interactions or couplings have yet emerged — the same differential structure continues to apply. The latent wave equation becomes a local wave equation over the now-resolved observable $X$,
$$
-	\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} + V(x) \psi = E \psi,
$$
with the potential term $V(x) = \lambda x^2$ inherited from the original resolution constraint in $M$-space. At this stage, the system’s dynamics are still informationally local: only curvature along the $X$-direction governs the flow.

This illustrates how the wave equation "survives" through the transition from latent M-space to active X-space — not as a relic of physics, but as a structure imposed by the information geometry of emergence. The wave-like behaviour is a property of the system's attempt to resolve a variable smoothly, under bounded entropy and curvature.

In subsequent stages, additional variables will activate, interactions will emerge, and the assumptions behind this local structure will begin to break down. We will return to this example to see how locality gives way to interaction and ultimately to collective dynamics.

\subsection{Example Continued: Activation of a Second Variable and the Onset of Coupling}

We now pick up the example after the emergence of the observable $X$. The system has begun to evolve along this direction, and the entropy gradient $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}$ has become anisotropic: curvature is concentrated along $\theta_X$, and the associated observable $H_X$ now governs dynamics in that direction.

But the system is still unfolding. As entropy increases, the Fisher matrix $G$ deforms: one of its previously latent eigenmodes — say, associated with a proto-coordinate $M{\prime}$ — begins to amplify. Eventually, the corresponding parameter $\theta_{M{\prime}}$ grows in gradient magnitude and crosses the activation threshold,
$$
\left[G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}\right]{M’} \geq \varepsilon{\text{activate}}.
$$
This triggers a second variable activation. As with $M$, we now reinterpret $M{\prime}$ as a resolvable coordinate $Y$, with associated observable $H_Y$, and a newly active degree of freedom.

At this stage, the Fisher Information Matrix begins to develop off-diagonal terms,
$$
G = \begin{pmatrix}
G_{XX} & G_{XY} \
G_{YX} & G_{YY}
\end{pmatrix},
$$
where $G_{XY} = \mathrm{Cov}(H_X, H_Y)$ encodes statistical coupling between the now-active variables. This signals the onset of interaction geometry: the system no longer evolves independently in each direction — structure begins to emerge in their joint behaviour.

What form does this coupling take?

To leading order, the entropy gradient becomes
$$
\frac{\text{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\text{d}t} \propto
\begin{pmatrix}
G_{XX} & G_{XY} \
G_{YX} & G_{YY}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\theta_X \
\theta_Y
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
G_{XX}\theta_X + G_{XY}\theta_Y \
G_{YX}\theta_X + G_{YY}\theta_Y
\end{pmatrix}
$$
So the evolution of $\theta_X$ now depends on $\theta_Y$, and vice versa. From the system's internal perspective, these variables are no longer "invisible" to each other. They are dynamically entangled — not necessarily in the quantum sense, but in the information-geometric sense of shared curvature and co-resolving structure.

This has a consequence for the local wave equations. Instead of separate differential equations for $\psi(x)$ and $\psi(y)$, the system now supports a joint amplitude $\psi(x, y)$ whose structure is shaped by the coupling. The latent resolution constraints that previously yielded separate harmonic potentials now become a joint constraint:
$$
\int (x^2 + y^2 + \eta x y), |\psi(x, y)|^2, dx,dy \geq \varepsilon^2,
$$
introducing an effective cross-term $\eta x y$ that reflects correlation in curvature — and leads to a new coupled wave-like equation of the form,
$$
- \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} \right)\psi(x, y)
- \lambda(x^2 + y^2 + \eta x y) \psi(x, y)
= \mu \psi(x, y).
$$

Again, this is not an imposed quantum equation — it is the natural outcome of internal geometry unfolding under resolution and curvature constraints. The system is discovering its own local interaction structure — and expressing it through the joint shape of uncertainty across active variables.

We interpret this as the onset of locality: the system has begun to form informational neighbourhoods. The variable $X$ is no longer alone — it interacts with $Y$ through a locally encoded geometry that reflects their mutual curvature.

In the next part, we will see how these local couplings condition future emergence — and how, as new variables activate, the system builds up layers of interaction structure that eventually resemble effective dynamics.

It’s clear, coherent, and beautifully in tune with the overall narrative. The transition from single-variable flow to emergent joint curvature and the onset of locality is well motivated and naturally leads to the next stage.

\subsection{Example Continued: Layered Interaction and Emergent Dynamics}

As additional variables activate, the system enters a new phase: interaction geometry becomes structured. The previously simple coupling between $X$ and $Y$ gives way to a richer, layered organisation, as each new activation introduces both curvature and correlation — reshaping the Fisher matrix into a nontrivial network of dependencies.

Suppose a third proto-coordinate M{\prime}{\prime} becomes active, emerging as a new observable $Z$ with associated parameter $\theta_Z$. The updated Fisher Information Matrix now includes second-order interactions,
$$
G = \begin{pmatrix}
G_{XX} & G_{XY} & G_{XZ} \
G_{YX} & G_{YY} & G_{YZ} \
G_{ZX} & G_{ZY} & G_{ZZ}
\end{pmatrix},
$$
where some off-diagonal terms (e.g. $G_{XZ}$, $G_{YZ}$) may remain small if interactions are local, while others (like $G_{XY}$) are stronger — reflecting proximity in information space.

The system is now discovering structured adjacency: some variables cluster into subsystems — regions of high mutual curvature — while others remain weakly linked. This defines a local information geometry, where coupling is not uniform but shaped by the system’s unfolding history.

This leads to several key features of emergent dynamics:
- Decoupling across scale: tightly coupled variables (e.g. $X$ and $Y$) evolve together, forming a subsystem, while distant variables (e.g. $Z$) initially evolve more independently. This creates a natural separation of timescales.
- Interaction propagation: as the entropy gradient flows, curvature can transfer across the network: initially weak links like $G_{XZ}$ may grow, triggering new variable activations and folding new directions into the active geometry.
- Wavefront emergence: activation spreads not randomly, but along paths of curvature flow — producing something like a propagating wave of structure, where adjacent variables successively activate and interact.
- Effective constraints: as more variables interact, the shape of $\psi(x, y, z, \dots)$ becomes increasingly governed by internal correlations. Even without any imposed Hamiltonian, the joint amplitude begins to obey effective rules, shaped by the accumulated geometry of interactions.

In this way, the system builds up a layered architecture: local couplings give rise to patches of structure, which may eventually synchronise into broader patterns. What began as latent directions and weak gradients becomes a dynamically coordinated system, where information geometry imposes both local motion and global constraint.

This is how effective dynamics emerge. The wave-like structure seen at early stages becomes modulated and conditioned by interactions. The internal rules — defined by curvature, resolution, and entropy flow — begin to resemble physical dynamics, even though they were never postulated.

In the next section, we’ll explore how these dynamics can give rise to classical behaviour and apparent decoherence — as the system moves from finely structured wave equations to effective, high-entropy flows where only coarse properties survive.

\subsection{Example Continued: Transition to Classical Regimes and the Emergence of Coarse Dynamics}

As the system continues to unfold, additional variables activate and the internal geometry becomes increasingly complex. The Fisher matrix now contains a dense web of off-diagonal structure — statistical dependencies across many observables — and the entropy has grown significantly. We enter a new regime.

In this regime, local curvature no longer defines sharp wave-like structure. Instead, the wavefunction $\psi(x, y, z, \dots)$ becomes spread out, structured more by accumulated correlations than by individual resolution constraints. The system approaches a high-entropy, high-dimensional configuration where fine distinctions are increasingly smoothed out.

This is the onset of effective classicality.

\paragraph{From Coherent Peaks to Broad Ensembles}

Initially, each variable activated with a clear informational gradient — each new direction brought curvature, distinctiveness, and wave-like structure. But as entropy grows, the joint distribution begins to blur: superpositions spread, interference patterns are damped by coarse-scale interactions, and $\psi(x, y, z, \dots)$ takes the form of a broad, semi-structured ensemble.

In this regime:
	•	The local wave equations still exist — they are encoded in the curvature — but they no longer dominate dynamics.
	•	The system behaves as if it samples from an evolving high-dimensional distribution, shaped more by entropy flow than by unitary evolution.
	•	The Fisher matrix still governs sensitivity to parameters, but in many directions, that sensitivity becomes effectively averaged out.

\paragraph{Emergent Decoherence Without Collapse}

What emerges is decoherence without measurement. Not in the standard physical sense — there is no environment, no external observer — but in the internal, information-geometric sense. The system loses the ability to maintain sharp internal interference between directions. Mutual curvature between clusters of variables acts like an internal decohering field: certain bases become preferred simply because they are more stable under curvature flow.

In practice:

-	Fine-grained amplitudes become inaccessible — suppressed by the entropy gradient and drowned in the higher-order coupling structure.
- Observable behaviour is governed by coarse statistical properties: marginals, means, variances, and correlations.
-	The system effectively transitions from wave-dominated evolution to a dynamics of coarse constraints and informational inertia.

\paragraph{Apparent Laws and Classical Motion}

From the inside, this transition gives rise to what appear as effective dynamical laws. These are not externally imposed equations of motion, but patterns in how information geometry evolves once the system becomes too high-dimensional to track in full.

For example:
- Activated clusters follow approximately deterministic trajectories — peaks in marginal distributions shift smoothly, like classical particles.
- Entropic forces emerge: systems tend to move toward configurations of greater curvature balance — analogous to energy minimisation.
-	Memory effects appear: previous curvature structures condition the space of possible future moves, giving rise to path dependence and feedback.

In short, the system begins to behave classically — not because the quantum rules have been replaced, but because the wave structure is now so layered and entangled that only the most stable, large-scale patterns persist. Geometry still rules, but in a statistical form.

\paragraph{Summary: From Curvature to Classicality}

We have traced a full arc:
	1.	Latent regime: a symmetric, curvature-minimised wave equation governs the silent geometry of $M$-space.
	2.	Variable activation: entropy gradient breaks symmetry; a direction becomes resolvable, and a wave equation reappears — now active.
	3.	Interaction onset: new directions activate; wavefunctions couple; the Fisher matrix acquires off-diagonal structure; locality and joint dynamics emerge.
	4.	Layered interaction: subsystems form, interactions propagate, and a network of informational flow develops.
	5.	Classical regime: entropy dominates; interference fades; wave structure gives way to ensemble dynamics governed by effective constraints.

Through this progression, the system evolves from an unstructured entropy minimum to a coarse but stable configuration governed by emergent geometry. What began as a game of curvature ends as a self-organised system with behaviour that mimics the laws of classical motion.

\subsection{Example Concluded: Summary and Structural Integration}

This extended example has traced the life cycle of a variable — from latent ambiguity to classical coherence — showing how internal information geometry governs the entire trajectory.

Let’s now step back and situate this narrative within the broader framework.

\paragraph{The Example as an Illustration of Core Principles}

Each stage of the unfolding process has instantiated one or more foundational components of the model:

Stage	Structure	Governing Principle
Latent $M$-space	Minimal wave-like density	Fisher curvature minimisation under resolution constraint
Variable activation ($M \rightarrow X$)	Threshold-triggered flow	Entropic gradient ascent via $G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \boldsymbol{\theta}$
Coupling ($X \leftrightarrow Y$)	Off-diagonal curvature	Emergence of locality through statistical interaction
Network growth ($X,Y,Z,\dots$)	Layered curvature structure	Directed flow across the unfolding Fisher topology
Classical transition	Loss of coherence, coarse structure	Effective dynamics via ensemble geometry

Each of these transitions is governed not by external forces or postulated laws, but by internal geometric conditions:
- Variance constraints impose curvature.
- Curvature shapes entropy gradients.
- Gradients activate variables.
- Activation reshapes the geometry.

The system’s dynamics are emergent in the strict sense: each new layer of behaviour is conditioned by — but not reducible to — the previous one. The Fisher Information Matrix $G$ acts as both memory and mediator, encoding the system’s informational shape at every stage.

\paragraph{The Role of the Example in the Larger Framework}

This example serves two roles:
	1.	Didactic — it offers a concrete narrative that tracks the abstract constructions (curvature, emergence, locality) through a single evolving trajectory.
	2.	Structural — it demonstrates how local wave equations, variable activation, basis adaptation, and emergent constraints can be woven into a self-organising dynamics without invoking physical assumptions.

We now return to the general framework, equipped with a working example of how internal information geometry generates unfolding structure. From here, we are ready to explore how these principles generalise — to multiple interacting subsystems, to emergent constraints across timescales, and to the geometry of coarse-grained laws.
