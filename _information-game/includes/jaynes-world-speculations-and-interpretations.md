\subsection{Speculative Implications and Hypotheses}

\notes{
- *Local Reversibility* within fixed symmetry classes
- *Latent Memory*: influence of inactive variables through curvature
- *Pseudo-Saddles*: slow evolution from flat entropy curvature
- *Conditional Independence*: emergent locality via block structure in $G$
- *Domain Transitions*: new behaviour as variables emerge or stall

\subsection{Connections to Information-Theoretic Literature}

\notes{The entropic dynamics and uncertainty principles in this framework connect directly to results from information theory and mathematical physics. 

@Hirschman-entropy57 first proposed using information entropy to express uncertainty relations, conjecturing that entropy-based formulations might be more fundamental than standard deviation approaches. His insight that information entropy constrains resolution across conjugate domains aligns with our system's precision-capacity trade-offs.

@Beckner-fourier75 provided proof of Hirschman's conjecture through Fourier analysis inequalities, establishing the sharp constants for entropy uncertainty relations. His work demonstrates mathematically why Gaussian states emerge as minimal-uncertainty configurations as we observe in our derivation of the minimal entropy density matrix.

@Bialynicki-uncertainty75 extended these principles to quantum mechanics, proving that entropy-based uncertainty relations imply the traditional Heisenberg principle rather than vice versa. Their demonstration that wave equations arise naturally from information-theoretic constraints motivates why Schrödinger-like equations emerge in our framework without imposed physical assumptions.

These papers establish that the wave-like behavior, uncertainty principles, and resolution constraints can emerge as information-theoretic necessities. 

Where our approach extends beyond these foundations is by placing them in a dynamic framework to allow the dynamics to unfold.}

\subsection{Interpretation and Nuance}

\subsubsection{1. Apparent Zero-Entropy Start}

\notes{
The game behaves as if it originates at low entropy, but this is a consequence of the entropy ascent, not an assumption.
}

\subsubsection{2. Discretisation from Entropy Capacity}

\notes{
Finite entropy bounds imply resolution constraints, producing discrete transitions without discretizing the space.
}

\subsubsection{3. Dual Role of Parameters and Variables}

\notes{
"$\theta_i \in X(t)$" means the observable governed by $H_i$ is actively evolving. Variables, parameters, and observables are dual facets of the representation.
}

\subsubsection{4. Irreversibility vs Local Reversibility}

\notes{
Monotonic entropy-time induces global irreversibility, but local symmetry classes may evolve reversibly.
}

\subsubsection{5. Fisher Information is an Analytic Tool}

\notes{
$G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ helps us understand evolution—it is not known or used by the system itself.
}

\subsubsection{6. No Observer or Collapse Needed}

\notes{
Structure emerges from the system’s internal curvature and resolution constraint, without measurement postulates.
}

\subsubsection{7. Singularity Avoidance}

\notes{
True singularities (e.g. delta functions) are excluded; minimal-entropy states are regularized via density matrices.
