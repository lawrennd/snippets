\subsection{Quantum States and Exponential Families}

\notes{The minimal entropy quantum states provides a  connection between density matrices and exponential family distributions. This connection enables us to use many of the classical techniques from information geometry and apply them to the game in the case where the uncertainty principle is present.}

\slides{
* Minimal entropy quantum states belong to exponential families
* Classical: $f(x; \theta) = h(x) \cdot \exp[\eta(\theta)^T \cdot T(x) - A(\theta)]$
* Density matrix: $\rho = \exp(-\mathbf{R}^T \cdot \mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{R} - Z)$
}
\notes{The minimal entropy density matrix belongs to an exponential family, just like many classical distributions,

\subsubsection{Classical Exponential Family}

$$
f(x; \theta) = h(x) \cdot \exp[\eta(\theta)^T \cdot T(x) - A(\theta)]
$$

\subsubsection{Quantum Minimal Entropy State}

$$
\rho = \exp(-\mathbf{R}^\top \cdot \mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{R} - Z)
$$

- Both have an exponential form
- Both involve sufficient statistics (in the quantum case, these are quadratic forms of operators)
- Both have natural parameters (G in the quantum case)
- Both include a normalization term}

\newslide{Fisher Information and the Uncertainty Principle}

\slides{
* Matrix G relates to quantum Fisher information:
  $$
  \mathbf{G} = \text{QFIM}/4
  $$
* Uncertainty-information relationship:
  $$
  V \cdot \text{QFIM} \geq \frac{\hbar^2}{4}
  $$
}

\notes{The matrix $G$ in the minimal entropy state is directly related to the 'quantum Fisher information matrix',
$$
\mathbf{G} = \text{QFIM}/4
$$
where QFIM is the quantum Fisher information matrix, which quantifies how sensitively the state responds to parameter changes.

This creates a link between

1. Minimal entropy (maximum order)
2. Uncertainty (fundamental quantum limitations)
3. Information (ability to estimate parameters precisely)

The relationship implies,
$$
V \cdot \text{QFIM} \geq \frac{\hbar^2}{4}
$$
which connects the covariance matrix (uncertainties) to the Fisher information (precision in parameter estimation).}

\newslide{Connection to Information Engines}

\slides{
* Minimal entropy states are optimal information engines
* They achieve maximum precision allowed by quantum mechanics
* Examples: squeezed states, coherent states, Gaussian entangled states
}

\notes{These minimal entropy states may have physical relationships to interpretations squeezed states in quantum optics. They are the states that achieve the ultimate precision allowed by quantum mechanics.}
