\subsection{Minimal Entropy States Under Quantum Constraints}

\notes{What is the most ordered state possible that still respects the uncertainty principle? This question connects directly to our understanding of information engines and the limits of information processing in physical systems.}

\slides{
* Quantum states have minimum entropy due to uncertainty principle
* Minimal entropy states are pure Gaussian states
* These represent fundamental information engines
}

\notes{In quantum mechanics, a system's state is described by a density matrix (ρ), which is analogous to a probability distribution in classical statistics. Key properties include,

- **Hermitian**: $\rho = \rho^\dagger$ (like how probability distributions are real-valued)
- **Positive semi-definite**: $\rho \geq 0$ (probabilities can't be negative)
- **Unit trace**: $\text{Tr}(\rho) = 1$ (total probability sums to 1)

For "pure" states (states with complete information), $\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$ where $|\psi\rangle$ is a state vector.}

\newslide{Von Neumann Entropy}

\slides{
* Quantum analog of Shannon entropy:
  $$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho)$$
* Pure states: $S(\rho) = 0$
* Mixed states: $S(\rho) > 0$
}

\notes{The density matrix analog of Shannon entropy is von Neumann entropy,
$$
S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho)
$$
This measures the amount of "mixedness" or uncertainty in a quantum state. Pure states have zero entropy, representing complete certainty about the quantum state (within the constraints of quantum mechanics). Mixed states have positive entropy, indicating some level of classical uncertainty.}

\newslide{Uncertainty Principle as a Constraint}

\slides{
* Position-momentum uncertainty:
  $$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$
* Matrix form for multiple variables:
  $$V + i\frac{\hbar}{2}\Omega \geq 0$$
}

\notes{Unlike classical systems, quantum mechanics imposes fundamental limits on precision through the uncertainty principle. For position (x) and momentum (p),
$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$
where $h$ (Planck's constant divided by $2\pi$) sets the scale of quantum effects.

For multiple variables, this generalizes to a matrix inequality:
$$
V + i\frac{\hbar}{2}\Omega \geq 0
$$
where $V$ is the covariance matrix containing all the uncertainties and correlations, and $\Omega$ is the symplectic form representing the canonical commutation relations.}

\notes{This constraint creates an irreducible minimum to the uncertainty possible in a quantum system, fundamentally different from classical constraints. It establishes the minimum "information cost" of any quantum system.}
