\section{Conclusion}

\notes{The zero-player game Jaynes' world provides a mathematical model for studying how complex systems evolve when they instantaneously maximize entropy production.}

\notes{Our analysis suggests the  game could illustrate the fundamental principles of information dynamics, including information conservation, an uncertainty principle, self-organization, and information-energy duality.}

\notes{The game's architecture should naturally organize into memory and processing components, without requiring explicit design.}

\notes{The game's temporal dynamics are based on steepest ascent in parameter space, this allows for analysis through the Fisher information matrix's eigenvalue structure to create a natural separation of timescales and the natural emergence of information reservoirs.}
