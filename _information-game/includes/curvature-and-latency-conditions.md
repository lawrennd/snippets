\subsection{Curvature and Latency Conditions}

\notes{The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) plays a crucial role in characterizing the curvature of the entropy landscape and determining the conditions under which observables become latent or active. The FIM is defined as
$$
G_{ij}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbb{E}_{\rho_\theta}\left[\frac{\partial \log \rho_\theta}{\partial \theta_i}\frac{\partial \log \rho_\theta}{\partial \theta_j}\right]
$$
where $\rho_\theta$ is the exponential family distribution with natural parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.}

\notes{The resolution threshold $\varepsilon$ determines when an observable becomes dynamically resolvable. An observable $H_i$ is considered "active" or "detectable" when its expected value or variance crosses a threshold,
$$
|\langle H_i \rangle - \langle H_i \rangle_0| \geq \varepsilon_1 \text{ or } \mathrm{var}(H_i) \geq \varepsilon_2
$$
where $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are resolution thresholds in observation space.}

\notes{The FIM can be partitioned based on the active observables:
$$
G(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \begin{bmatrix} G_{XX} & G_{XM} \\ G_{MX} & G_{MM} \end{bmatrix}
$$
where $G_{XX}$ corresponds to active observables, $G_{MM}$ to latent observables, and $G_{XM}$ and $G_{MX}$ represent the coupling between active and latent observables.}

\notes{The Schur complement of $G_{MM}$ in $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is defined as
$$
G^\prime_X = G_{XX} - G_{XM}G_{MM}^{-1}G_{MX}
$$
This matrix $G^\prime_X$ represents the effective information geometry for the active observables after accounting for their coupling to the latent observables.}

\notes{The curvature conditions for latency can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the FIM. A parameter $\theta_i$ is considered latent if the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ of $G(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ satisfies
$$
\lambda_i < \varepsilon^2
$$
This condition indicates that the parameter's contribution to the system's information geometry is below the resolution threshold.}

\notes{The latency condition can also be expressed in terms of the observable expectations. An observable $H_i$ is latent if its expectation and variance are both below the resolution thresholds,
$$
|\langle H_i \rangle - \langle H_i \rangle_0| < \varepsilon_1 \text{ and } \mathrm{var}(H_i) < \varepsilon_2,
$$
This formulation emphasizes that latency is a property of the observable space rather than the parameter space.}

\notes{The relationship between the entropy bound $N$ and the resolution threshold $\varepsilon$ affects the conditions for latency. As the entropy bound increases, the resolution threshold decreases, allowing for the detection of more subtle features in the system. This suggests that systems with higher entropy bounds can maintain more active observables, leading to more complex and nuanced behavior.}

\notes{The curvature and latency conditions have important implications for the system's evolution. Parameters associated with latent observables evolve more slowly, as their contributions to the gradient flow are below the resolution threshold. This creates a natural separation of time scales in the system's dynamics, with active observables evolving quickly and latent observables evolving slowly or remaining fixed.}

\notes{This separation of time scales is reflected in the structure of the FIM. The block $G_{XX}$ corresponds to the fast dynamics of active observables, while $G_{MM}$ corresponds to the slow dynamics of latent observables. The off-diagonal blocks $G_{XM}$ and $G_{MX}$ represent the coupling between these different time scales.}

\notes{Â¿The curvature and latency conditions also have implications for the system's computational complexity.? By focusing on active observables and treating latent observables as fixed, the system can efficiently evolve in a reduced parameter space. This sparsification of the dynamics is a natural consequence of the resolution constraint and provides a mechanism for managing computational complexity in large-scale systems.}

\notes{Understanding the curvature and latency conditions is crucial for predicting the system's evolution and identifying the most likely paths of emergence. It also provides insights into the relationship between information geometry and physical dynamics, suggesting that the resolution constraint might be a feature of information-based physical systems.}
