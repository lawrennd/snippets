\subsection{Least Action Principles in Information Acquisition}

\notes{
In physics, the principle of least action states that the path taken by a physical system between two states is the one that minimizes the action, an integral of the Lagrangian over time. This principle unifies many fundamental laws of physics.

We can draw a parallel between this principle and intelligent information acquisition in the entropy game. The "action" in information space can be defined as the cumulative entropy along a path of questions. The optimal questioning strategy follows a path that minimizes this action - effectively reducing entropy as quickly as possible.

Mathematically, if we have a sequence of questions $q_1, q_2, ..., q_n$ that transforms our belief state from an initial distribution $p_0$ to a final distribution $p_n$, the information action can be defined as
$$
S[q] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} H(p_i).
$$
The principle of least action in information space suggests that intelligence follows paths that minimize this sum - effectively reducing entropy as efficiently as possible.

This connects the seemingly disparate fields of physics and intelligence, suggesting that intelligent systems follow optimization principles analogous to those in physical systems.
