\subsection{The Inaccessible Game Setup}

\notes{Inspired by the no-barber principle, we set up the game in a way that attempts to avoid "external structure". The first two things we need to do this are 
1. A representation of information loss
2. A prohibition of information exchange with the game

At this point there's a challenge, how do we obtain a representation of information loss without including external structure? Our best suggestion is the axiomatic frameworks of Baez et al (@Baez-characterisation11) and Parzygnat (@Parzygnat-functorial22). Both these works characterise entropy through category theory frameworks that depend on three axioms. Slight differences in the axioms result in different conclusions. Baez et al conclude that difference in Shannon entropy before and after a process is applied characterises information loss. Parzygnat is inspired by Baez et al but suggests that difference in von Neumann entropy is preferred.}
