\subsection{Schrödinger's Bridge and Optimal Information Transport}

\notes{
Schrödinger's bridge problem addresses a fundamental question: given initial and final probability distributions, what is the most likely stochastic process connecting them? Originally posed by Erwin Schrödinger in 1931, this problem has found applications in optimal transport, stochastic control, and more recently, machine learning.

In the context of the entropy game, we can interpret this as finding the optimal sequence of questions that transforms our belief state from the initial distribution (maximum uncertainty) to the final distribution (certainty about the target). Each question modifies the probability distribution, guiding it toward the target.

The connection becomes even more apparent when we consider that Schrödinger's bridge can be formulated as a minimum relative entropy problem. If we denote by $Q$ the measure of a reference process and by $P$ the measure of an admissible process, Schrödinger's bridge finds $P$ that minimizes the relative entropy:
$$
D_{KL}(P||Q) = \int \log\left(\frac{dP}{dQ}\right)dP
$$
subject to constraints on the initial and final distributions.

In the entropy game, each question can be viewed as a control action that steers the probability distribution. The optimal questioning strategy creates a "bridge" between distributions that minimizes the expected number of questions - directly analogous to Schrödinger's bridge finding the most likely path between distributions.
