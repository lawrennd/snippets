\subsection{Minimal Entropy States}

\notes{In Jaynes' World, we begin at a minimal entropy configuration - the "origin" state. Understanding the properties of these minimal entropy states is crucial for characterizing how the system evolves. These states are constrained by the uncertainty principle we previously identified: $\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}(M) \cdot \Delta c(M) \geq k$.}

\slides{
* Minimal entropy states ("origin" in Jaynes' World)
* Constrained by uncertainty principle:
  * $\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}(M) \cdot \Delta c(M) \geq k$
* Fundamental limit on information structure
}

\notes{This constraint is reminiscient of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, where $\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \hbar/2$. This isn't a coincidence - both represent limitations on precision arising from the mathematical structure of information.}

\subsection{Structure of Minimal Entropy States}

\slides{
* Minimal entropy states have:
  * Pure Gaussian form in parameter space
  * Exactly saturate uncertainty bound
  * Belong to exponential family
* Total entropy bounded: $S(Z) = 0$ for minimal states, with $0 \leq S(Z) \leq N$ overall
}

\notes{The minimal entropy configuration under the uncertainty constraint takes a specific mathematical form. It is a pure state (in the sense of having minimal possible entropy, $S(Z) = 0$) that exactly saturates the uncertainty bound. For a system with multiple degrees of freedom, the distribution takes a Gaussian form,
$$
\rho(Z) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}\exp(-\mathbf{R}^T \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \cdot \mathbf{R}),
$$
where $\mathbf{R}$ represents the vector of all variables, $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is the precision matrix (inverse covariance) constrained by the uncertainty principle, and $\mathcal{Z}$ is the partition function (normalization constant).
}

\notes{This form is an exponential family distribution, in line with Jaynes' principle that entropy-optimized distributions belong to the exponential family. The precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ determines how uncertainty is distributed among different variables and their correlations. Importantly, while minimal entropy states have $S(Z) = 0$, the total entropy of the system is constrained to be between 0 and $N$ as it evolves, forming a compact manifold with respect to its parameters. This upper bound $N$ ensures that as the system evolves from minimal to maximal entropy, it remains within a well-defined entropy space.}

\subsection{Fisher Information and Minimal Uncertainty}

\slides{
* Precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ directly related to Fisher information
* $\mathbf{G} = \boldsymbol{\Lambda}/2$ (Fisher information matrix)
* Creates relationship:
  * $\mathbf{V} \cdot \mathbf{G} \geq k^2$
}

\notes{There's a connection between the precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ and the Fisher information matrix $\mathbf{G}$. For a multivariate Gaussian distribution, the Fisher information matrix is proportional to the precision matrix: $\mathbf{G} = \boldsymbol{\Lambda}/2$. This creates the relationship,
$$
\mathbf{V} \cdot \mathbf{G} \geq k^2
$$
where $\mathbf{V}$ is the covariance matrix containing all uncertainties and correlations. This inequality connects the covariance (uncertainties) to the Fisher information (precision in parameter estimation).}

\subsection{Connection to Information Reservoirs}

\slides{
* Information reservoir $M$ at minimal entropy:
  * Stores information in wave-like patterns
  * Distributes uncertainty optimally
  * Creates non-local correlations
}

\subsection{Implications for System Evolution}

\slides{
* As system evolves from minimal entropy:
  * Uncertainty bound becomes less saturated
  * Information encoding transitions from wave-like to particle-like
  * System moves from quantum-like to classical-like behavior
}

\notes{As Jaynes' World evolves from its minimal entropy state toward maximum entropy, we expect transitions to occur, *Uncertainty desaturation*: The uncertainty relationship $\Delta\boldsymbol{\theta}(M) \cdot \Delta c(M) \geq k$ becomes less tightly saturated, with the product growing larger than the minimum value.}

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

\slides{
* Minimal entropy states analogous to:
  * Squeezed states in quantum optics
  * Ground states of many-body systems
  * Coherent structures in complex systems
}

\notes{Understanding these minimal entropy states provides insight into the starting point of Jaynes' World and illuminates how the system will evolve toward maximum entropy. The uncertainty principle we've identified represents not just a mathematical constraint but a fundamental limitation on how information can be structured in any system.}

\notes{The concept of minimal entropy states has an analog in quantum mechanics. What is the most ordered state possible that still respects the quantum uncertainty principle? }

\slides{
* Quantum states have minimum entropy due to uncertainty principle
* Minimal entropy states are pure Gaussian states
* These represent fundamental information engines
}

\notes{In quantum mechanics, a system's state is described by a density matrix $\rho$, which is analogous to a probability distribution in classical statistics. Key properties include,

- **Hermitian**: $\rho = \rho^\dagger$ (like how probability distributions are real-valued)
- **Positive semi-definite**: $\rho \geq 0$ (probabilities can't be negative)
- **Unit trace**: $\text{Tr}(\rho) = 1$ (total probability sums to 1)

For pure quantum states (states with complete information), $\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$ where $|\psi\rangle$ is a state vector.}

\newslide{Von Neumann Entropy}

\slides{
* Quantum analog of Shannon entropy:
  $$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho)$$
* Pure states: $S(\rho) = 0$
* Mixed states: $S(\rho) > 0$
}

\notes{The density matrix analog of Shannon entropy is von Neumann entropy,
$$
S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho)
$$
This measures the amount of "mixedness" or uncertainty in a quantum state. Pure states have zero entropy, representing complete certainty about the quantum state (within the constraints of quantum mechanics). Mixed states have positive entropy, indicating some level of classical uncertainty.}

\newslide{Quantum Uncertainty Principle as a Constraint}

\slides{
* Position-momentum uncertainty:
  $$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$
* Matrix form for multiple variables:
  $$V + i\frac{\hbar}{2}\Omega \geq 0$$
}
\notes{The uncertainty principle imposes fundamental limits on precision through the uncertainty principle. For position ($x$) and momentum ($p$),
$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$
where $\hbar$ (Planck's constant divided by $2\pi$) sets the scale of quantum effects.

For multiple variables, this generalizes to a matrix inequality,
$$
V + i\frac{\hbar}{2}\Omega \geq 0,
$$
where $V$ is the covariance matrix containing all the uncertainties and correlations, and $\Omega$ is the symplectic form representing the canonical commutation relations.}

\notes{This constraint creates an irreducible minimum to the uncertainty possible in the system, it establishes the minimum "information state" of the system.}


\subsection{Density Matrices and Exponential Families}

\notes{The minimal entropy state provides a connection between density matrices and exponential family distributions. This connection enables us to use many of the classical techniques from information geometry and apply them to the game in the case where the uncertainty principle is present.}

\slides{
* Minimal entropy quantum states belong to exponential families
* Classical: $f(x; \theta) = h(x) \cdot \exp[\eta(\theta)^\top \cdot T(x) - A(\theta)]$
* Density matrix: $\rho = \exp(-\mathbf{R}^T \cdot \mathbf{G} \cdot \mathbf{R} - Z)$
}

\notes{The minimal entropy density matrix belongs to an exponential family, just like many classical distributions.}

\notes{
- Both have an exponential form
- Both involve sufficient statistics (in the quantum case, these are quadratic forms of operators)
- Both have natural parameters ($G$ in the quantum case)
- Both include a normalization term
}
