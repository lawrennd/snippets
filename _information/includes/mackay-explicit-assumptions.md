\subsection{MacKay's Legacy: Explicit Assumptions}

\notes{David MacKay's work was characterized by insistence on **explicit assumptions** and **operational clarity**. Whether in information theory, Bayesian inference, or sustainable energy, David demanded that we state clearly:
- What are we assuming?
- What can we actually measure?
- What follows rigorously from those assumptions?}

\slides{
**MacKay's Approach:**
* Make assumptions explicit
* State what's measurable
* Derive consequences rigorously

*No hidden dependencies*
}

\notes{In his work on information theory and inference [@MacKay-information03], David showed how making assumptions explicit—about prior knowledge, about noise models, about what information is available—clarifies both what we can conclude and what remains uncertain.}

\notes{In his work on sustainable energy [@MacKay-sustainable08], he showed how explicit accounting of physical constraints—energy densities, land areas, material flows—cuts through wishful thinking and reveals hard limits.}

\newslide{Games and Inference}

\notes{In games like Conway's Life or Wolfram's cellular automata, the rules are explicit and self-contained. But in many analytic frameworks, we often take **implicit adjudicators** for granted:
- Who decides which configurations are distinguishable?
- What defines the outcome space?
- Who measures time?
- What determines the decomposition into subsystems?}

\slides{
**Games:** Rules explicit and self-contained

**Analytic frameworks:** Often assume:
* External distinguishability
* Pre-defined outcomes
* External clock
* Privileged decomposition

*Hidden adjudicators*
}

\subsection{Towards Internally Adjudicable Rules}

\notes{What if we follow MacKay's principle to its logical conclusion and forbid such external adjudication? What if we seek only rules that can be applied from within the system itself?

This leads to a natural question: **What structures and constraints emerge when we demand internal adjudicability?**}

\slides{
**MacKay's principle extended:**

*Forbid external adjudication*

**Question:**
What emerges when rules must be internally adjudicable?

*This motivates the no-barber principle*
}

\notes{The inaccessible game is an exploration of this question. By demanding that all rules, constraints, and selection criteria be expressible without external reference, we discover that specific mathematical structures emerge—not by assumption, but by necessity.}
