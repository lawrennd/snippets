\subsection{In Memory of David MacKay}

\notes{This talk is given at a memorial meeting for David MacKay, who made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the relationship between information theory, energy, and practical systems. David's work on information theory and inference provided elegant bridges between abstract mathematical principles and real-world applications.}

\notes{David's book "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" [@MacKay-information03] demonstrated how information-theoretic thinking could illuminate everything from error-correcting codes to neural networks to thermodynamics. His later work on sustainable energy [@MacKay-energy08] showed how careful quantitative reasoning about physical constraints could cut through hype and wishful thinking.}

**David MacKay (1967-2016)**
* Information theory and inference
* Neural networks and learning algorithms  
* Sustainable energy and physical limits
* Cut through hype with careful reasoning
}

\notes{The work I present today on the inaccessible game follows in this tradition. It attempts to build rigorous information-theoretic foundations for understanding physical systems and, by extension, the limits on intelligent systems. David would have appreciated both the mathematical structure and the attempt to use it to deflate unrealistic promises about superintelligence.}

\notes{As David told us ten years ago, he was highly inspired by John Bridle telling him (as an undergraduate student) "everything's connected". In his book "Sustainable Energy, Without the Hot Air" David taught us to ask: "What are the fundamental constraints? What do the numbers actually say?" In that spirit, this work asks: What fundamental information-theoretic constraints govern intelligent systems? Can we understand these constraints as rigorously as we understand thermodynamic constraints on engines?}

**David's Approach:**
* Start with fundamental principles
* Build rigorous mathematical framework
* Apply to real systems
* Use numbers to test claims

*Today:* Apply this to information & energy
