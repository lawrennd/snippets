\subsection{Implications for Theory Construction}

\notes{The inaccessible game is a mathematical framework—a formal game with precise rules. But the **no-barber principle** that underlies it may have broader relevance.}

\notes{If we think of scientific theories as games played against nature, then perhaps ensuring that theoretical rules don't silently rely on external adjudicators could be an interesting constraint on theory construction.}

\slides{
**A Thought:**

Scientific theories = games against nature?

**Question:** Should theory rules avoid external adjudicators?

*Constraint on how we construct theories*
}

\newslide{What Would This Mean?}

\notes{Consider how often in physics and mathematics we appeal to:
- A pre-existing space-time arena
- An external notion of simultaneity
- A privileged basis or coordinate system
- An observer who "collapses" quantum states
- A distinguished decomposition into system and environment}

\notes{The no-barber principle asks: what if we couldn't appeal to these? What structures would have to emerge internally? The inaccessible game is one exploration of this question in the domain of information dynamics.}

\slides{
**Common External Appeals:**
* Pre-existing spacetime
* External simultaneity
* Privileged coordinates
* External observers
* System/environment split

**No-barber asks:** What if these must emerge?
}

\subsection{Not a Grand Claim}

\notes{We are **not** claiming that:
- Reality must obey the inaccessible game's rules
- All theories must satisfy the no-barber principle
- This solves foundational problems in physics

Rather, we're offering a **principled constraint** and exploring what follows. If it proves useful for understanding certain phenomena or for constructing internally consistent theories, that would be interesting. If not, the mathematical structure may still illuminate the relationship between information, geometry, and dynamics.}

\slides{
**Not claiming:**
* Reality = inaccessible game
* All theories need no-barber
* This solves foundations

**Offering:**
* Principled constraint
* Exploration of consequences
* Mathematical illumination

*Question, not conclusion*
}

\notes{This is in the spirit of MacKay's approach: make assumptions explicit, explore consequences rigorously, and see what the mathematics reveals. Whether these ideas apply beyond the formal game remains an open question.}
