\subsection{Perpetual Motion and Superintelligence}

\notes{Imagine in 1925 a world where the automobile is already transforming society, but big promises are being made for things to come. The stock market is soaring, the 1918 pandemic is forgotten. And every major automobile manufacturer is investing heavily on the promise they will each be the first to produce a car that needs no fuel. A perpetual motion machine.}

\notes{Well, of course that didn't happen. But I sometimes wonder if what we're seeing today 100 years later is the modern equivalent of that. In 2025 billions are being invested in promises of superintelligence and artificial general intelligence that will transform everything.}

\newslide{Why Perpetual Motion Failed}

\notes{We know why perpetual motion is impossible: the second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy always increases. So we can't have motion without entropy production. No matter how clever the design, you cannot extract energy from nothing, and you cannot create a closed system that does useful work indefinitely without an external energy source.}

\slides{
**Second Law of Thermodynamics:**

$$\frac{\text{d}H}{\text{d}t} \geq 0$$

* Entropy always increases
* No motion without entropy production
* No work without energy input
}

\newslide{An Equivalent Statement for Intelligence?}

\notes{How might we make an equivalent statement for the bizarre claims around superintelligence? Some inspiration comes from Maxwell's demon, an "intelligent" entity which operates against the laws of thermodynamics. The inspiration comes because the demon suggests that for the second law to hold there must be a relationship between the demon's decisions and thermodynamic entropy.}

\notes{One of the resolutions comes from Landauer's principle, the notion that erasure of information requires heat dissipation. This suggests there are fundamental information-theoretic constraints on intelligent systems, just as there are thermodynamic constraints on engines.}

\slides{
**Maxwell's Demon:**
* "Intelligent" entity that violates 2nd law
* Resolution: Landauer's principle
* Information erasure requires energy

**Implication:**
* Intelligence has thermodynamic cost
* Information processing has physical limits
}

\notes{I've no doubt that AI technologies will transform our world just as much as the automobile has. But I also have no doubt that the promise of superintelligence is just as silly as the promise of perpetual motion. The inaccessible game provides one way of understanding why.}
