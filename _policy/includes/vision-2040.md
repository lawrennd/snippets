\notes{Looking ahead to 2040, we envision an ecosystem where AI serves as a genuine catalyst for societal progress. This vision builds on three key elements:

1. Human-centered AI systems that enhance rather than replace scientific expertise
2. Strong communities of professions that facilitate knowledge sharing and innovation
3. Sustainable models of attention reinvestment that allow continuous improvement

Success requires maintaining focus on human needs and capabilities while leveraging technological advances. The role of universities and research institutions will be crucial in bridging the gap between technical possibility and practical value.}
