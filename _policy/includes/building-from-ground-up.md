\notes{Work across Cambridgeshire demonstrates effective ground-up innovation in action. In local government, Greater Cambridge Shared Planning collaborates with universities to develop AI tools that analyse public consultation responses. This partnership has potential to reduce staff analysis time from over a year to just two months, while maintaining planning expertise at the heart of the process.

Similar successes emerged during COVID-19, when NHS England East collaborated with researchers to develop AI models supporting hospital resource allocation. This partnership showed how AI can enhance operational decisions when developed alongside those who understand local needs.

In healthcare, clinician-led development of AI tools for cancer diagnosis demonstrates how frontline expertise can ensure AI enhances rather than replaces professional judgment. Key success factors include:

1. Local expertise driving development priorities
2. Solutions addressing concrete operational challenges
3. Professional judgment remaining central
4. Iterative development based on real-world feedback}
