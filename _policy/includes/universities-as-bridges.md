\notes{Universities occupy a unique position in the innovation ecosystem. As neutral conveners, they can bring together diverse communities of expertise, from engineering to ethics. Their access to research capabilities and human capital makes them vital for the next wave of AI innovation.

Universities can create spaces where people working to deploy AI in public services and industry can collaborate with diverse communities of expertise. This role is particularly important for:

1. Facilitating dialogue between technology developers and users
2. Providing ethical oversight and governance frameworks
3. Supporting knowledge transfer between research and practice
4. Building capacity through education and training}
