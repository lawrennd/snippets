\section{Piecemeal Social Engineers}

\notes{Karl Popper introduced the concept of "piecemeal social engineering" in his seminal work "The Open Society and Its Enemies". This approach advocates for incremental, careful changes to social institutions rather than wholesale revolutionary transformations. The piecemeal social engineer recognizes that we cannot predict all consequences of our actions and therefore must proceed carefully, learning from mistakes.}

* Piecemeal social engineering (Popper):
  * Incremental changes vs revolutionary transformation
  * Learning from mistakes
  * Focus on specific problems
  * Democratic institutionalism

\notes{In the context of AI and technological change, we need modern piecemeal social engineers who can:
1. Bridge between different domains of expertise
2. Understand both technical and social implications
3. Make careful, reversible changes
4. Build feedback mechanisms into deployments
5. Maintain democratic accountability}

\notes{This approach is relevant as we deploy AI systems that fundamentally alter social institutions. Failures of digitalsystems like Horizon and Lorenzo demonstrate what happens when we ignore the need for careful, piecemeal change and instead attempt wholesale transformation without adequate feedback mechanisms.}
