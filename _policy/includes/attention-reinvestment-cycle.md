\subsection{The Attention Reinvestment Cycle}

\notes{Traditional innovation models in technology assume that productivity improvements translate directly into financial returns. However, when it comes to deploying AI in sectors of public importance, this model often fails because the economic incentives don't align with societal needs.}

\slides{
* Traditional innovation flywheel: R&D → Innovation → Productivity → Economic Surplus → R&D
* Problem: Misalignment with societal needs in healthcare, education, social care

\newslide{A New Model for Innovation}

\notes{The attention reinvestment cycle represents an alternative approach to innovation deployment. Instead of focusing primarily on financial returns, it recognizes that efficiency gains can be measured through the liberation of human attention - our most precious resource in the digital age.}

\slides{
* Attention Reinvestment Cycle liberates human attention
* Freed attention reinvested in knowledge networks
* Creates value through improved human services

\notes{In the attention reinvestment cycle, technology deployments that free up human attention in critical domains like healthcare, education, and social services create value by allowing professionals to focus on the human aspects of their work that cannot be automated. The freed attention is reinvested through networks that share knowledge and best practices, creating a virtuous cycle that builds capacity throughout the system.}

\notes{This model is particularly well-suited to sectors where human attention is both vitally important and chronically constrained. By prioritizing attention liberation over pure financial returns, it creates a pathway for innovation to address societal needs even when traditional market incentives are insufficient. This approach has been explored in the African context through initiatives like Data Science Africa @Lawrence-dsa15.}
