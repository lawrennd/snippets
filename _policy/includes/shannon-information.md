\subsection{Information Theory and AI}

\notes{To properly understand the relationship between human and
machine intelligence, we need to step back from eugenic notions of
rankable intelligence toward a more fundamental measure: information
theory.}

* Claude Shannon developed information theory at Bell Labs
* Information measured in bits, separated from context
* Makes information fungible and comparable

\notes{The field of *information theory* was introduced by Claude
Shannon, an American mathematician who worked for Bell Labs
@Shannon-info48. Shannon was trying to understand how to make the most
efficient use of resources within the telephone network. To do this he
developed an approach to quantifying information by associating it
with probability, making information fungible by removing context.}

* Humans speaking: ~2,000 bits per minute
* Machines communicating: ~600 billion bits per minute
* Machines share information 300 million times faster than humans
}

\notes{A typical human, when speaking, shares information at around
2,000 bits per minute. Two machines will share information at 600
billion bits per minute. In other words, machines can share
information 300 million times faster than us. This is equivalent to us
traveling at walking pace, and the machine traveling at the speed of
light.}

\notes{From this perspective, machine decision-making belongs to an
utterly different realm to that of humans. Consideration of the
relative merits of the two needs to take these differences into
account. This difference between human and machine underpins the
revolution in algorithmic decision-making that has already begun
reshaping our society @Lawrence-atomic24.}
