\notes{To properly understand the relationship between human and machine intelligence, we need to step back from eugenic notions of rankable intelligence toward a more fundamental measure: information theory.}

* Claude Shannon developed information theory at Bell Labs
* Information measured in bits, separated from context
* Makes information fungible and comparable

\notes{The field of *information theory* was introduced by Claude Shannon, an American mathematician who worked for Bell Labs @Shannon-info48. Shannon was trying to understand how to make the most efficient use of resources within the telephone network. To do this he developed an approach to quantifying information by associating it with probability, making information fungible by removing context.}

\slides{
* Humans speaking: ~2,000 bits per minute
* Machines communicating: ~600 billion bits per minute
* Machines share information 300 million times faster than humans
}

\notes{A typical human, when speaking, shares information at around 2,000 bits per minute. Two machines will share information at 600 billion bits per minute. In other words, machines can share information 300 million times faster than us. This is equivalent to us traveling at walking pace, and the machine traveling at the speed of light.}

\notes{From this perspective, machine decision-making belongs to an utterly different realm to that of humans. Consideration of the relative merits of the two needs to take these differences into account. This difference between human and machine underpins the revolution in algorithmic decision-making that has already begun reshaping our society @Lawrence-atomic24.}
