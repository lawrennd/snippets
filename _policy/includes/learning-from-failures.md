\newslide{Common Patterns of Failure}

* Insufficient understanding of local context
* Missing feedback loops
* Rigid top-down implementation

\notes{The history of IT implementation in the public sector provides crucial lessons for AI deployment. The Horizon Post Office scandal, where over 700 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to software errors, demonstrates the catastrophic consequences of implementing systems without understanding local needs and workflows.

Similarly, the Lorenzo NHS IT project failed largely because it didn't account for how healthcare professionals actually work. These cases share common patterns:

1. Systems designed without considering integration into existing workflows
2. Lack of effective feedback mechanisms preventing early problem identification
3. Rigid implementation approaches that didn't allow for local variation
4. Insufficient testing in real-world conditions

These failures highlight the importance of bottom-up, human-centered approaches to technology implementation.}
