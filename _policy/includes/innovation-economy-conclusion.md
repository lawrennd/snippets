\notes{ai@cam's approach aims to address the macro-micro disconnects in AI innovation through several key strategies. We are building bridges between macro and micro levels, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, engaging diverse stakeholders and voices, and providing crucial resources and training. Through these efforts, ai@cam is working to create a more integrated and effective AI innovation ecosystem.}

\notes{Our implementation approach emphasizes several critical elements learned from past IT implementation failures. We focus on flexibility to adapt to changing needs, phased rollout of initiatives to manage risk, establishing continuous feedback loops for improvement, and maintaining a learning mindset throughout the process.}

\notes{Looking to the future, we recognize that AI technologies and their applications will continue to evolve rapidly. This evolution requires strategic agility and a continued focus on effective implementation. We will need to remain adaptable, continuously assessing and adjusting our strategies while working to bridge capability gaps between high-level AI capabilities and on-the-ground implementation challenges.}
