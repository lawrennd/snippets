\subsection{New Productivity Paradox}

\slides{* Current productivity flywheel relies on measurement to translate innovation into productivity.
* Without measurement how does the wheel spin?}

\notes{Thus we face a new productivity paradox. The classical tools of economic intervention cannot map hard-to-measure supply and demand of quality human attention. So how do we build a new economy that utilises our lead in human capital and delivers the digital future we aspire to?}

\notes{One answer is to look at the human capital index. This measures the quality and quantity of the attention economy via the health and education of our population.}


\notes{We need to value this and find a way to reinvest human capital, returning the value of the human back into the system when considering productivity gains from technology like AI.}

\notes{This means a tighter mapping between what the public want and what the innovation economy delivers. It means more agile policy that responds to public dialogue with tangible solutions co-created with the people who are doing the actual work. It means, for example, freeing up a nurse’s time with technology tools and allowing them to spend that time with patients.}

\notes{To deliver this, our academic institutions need to step up. Too often in the past we have been distant from the difficulties that society faces. We have been too remote from the real challenges of everyday lives — challenges that don’t make the covers of prestige science magazines. People are rightly angry that innovations like AI have yet to address the problems they face, including in health, social care and education.}

\notes{Of course, universities cannot fix this on their own, but academics can operate as honest brokers that bridge gaps between public and private considerations, convene different groups and understand, celebrate and empower the contributions of individuals.}

\notes{This requires people who are prepared to dedicate their time to improving each other’s lives, developing new best practices and sharing them with colleagues and coworkers.}

\notes{To preserve our human capital and harness our potential, we need the AI alchemists to provide us with solutions that can serve both science and society.}
