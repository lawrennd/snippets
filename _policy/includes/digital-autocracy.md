\subsection{The Risk of Digital Autocracy}

\notes{The digital revolution has shifted power into the hands of those who control data and algorithmic decision-making. In ancient societies, scribes preserved their power through strict controls on who could read and write, deciding what forms of writing were considered authoritative. In Europe, this institutional protection eroded with the emergence of printing in the fifteenth century, dispersing power through the modern professions @Fischer-writing01.}

* Information control creates power imbalances in society

\newslide{Modern Information Asymmetries}

\notes{Today, control has shifted into what we might call the digital oligarchy. The modern scribe is the software engineer and their guild is the tech company, but society has not yet evolved to align the power these entities have with the social responsibilities needed to ensure wise deployment @Lawrence-atomic24.}

* Algorithmic attention rents: excess returns from data control
* Human attention becomes the bottleneck in the system
* Power without corresponding social responsibility

\notes{The attention economy leads to a challenge where automated decision-making is combined with asymmetry of information access. Some have more control of data than others, creating power imbalances. This phenomenon leads to what has been described as "algorithmic attention rents" - excess returns over what would normally be available in a competitive market @OReilly-algorithmic23.}

\notes{In 1944, Karl Popper responded to the threat of fascism with "The Open Society and its Enemies," emphasizing that change in the open society comes through trusting our institutions and their members - the piecemeal social engineers @Popper-open45. The failure to engage these social engineers leads to failures like the Horizon scandal and the failur of the National Programme for IT (the Lorenzo project, @Justinia-npfit17). We cannot afford to make those mistakes again, as they would lead to a dysfunctional digital autocracy that would be difficult or even impossible to recover from.}
