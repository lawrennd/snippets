\subsection{The Innovation Flywheel}

\notes{The traditional model of technological innovation and value creation in commercial settings follows a self-reinforcing cycle often referred to as the innovation flywheel. This model has driven technological progress but tends to prioritise innovations with clear economic returns.}

\slides{
* Invests in R&D to produce technical innovations
* Innovations deployed as productivity improvements
* Improvements generate economic surplus
* Surplus reinvested in further R&D

\notes{This cyclical process begins with investment in research and development, which produces technical innovations that can be deployed as productivity improvements or new products. These innovations generate economic surplus through increased efficiency or new revenue streams, which can then be reinvested to fund further R&D efforts @Hounshell-science89.}

\notes{While effective for commercial innovation, this model creates a potential disconnect between technological advancement and social value when societal needs don't align with economic incentives. The flywheel's dependence on quantifiable economic returns can leave significant public needs unaddressed, particularly in areas where value is harder to measure or monetise.}

\notes{For organizations to effectively benefit from innovation, they need what @Cohen-absorptive90 termed "absorptive capacity" - the ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends. However, the new productivity challenge we face now is not only about how organisations absorb technology but how they deploy it in domains of societal importance. This disconnect helps explain why, despite significant technological advances, innovations often fail to address society's most pressing challenges in the so-called wicked problems [@Rittel-dilemmas73], domains like healthcare, education, and social services where market incentives may be insufficient or misaligned.}
