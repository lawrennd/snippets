\subsection{The New Productivity Paradox}

\notes{In the 1970s and 1980s, significant investment in computing wasn't accompanied by a corresponding increase in economic productivity. This challenge was characterized as a "productivity paradox" by Erik Brynjolfsson in 1993, where benefits of computational investment lagged behind the investment itself [@Brynjolfsson-productivity93].}

* Original productivity paradox: investment without returns
* Required organizational restructuring to realize benefits
* Example: Amazon's API mandate reorganized structure around software

\notes{Part of the explanation for this lag was down to the need for organizations to adapt their corporate infrastructure to make best use of the new information infrastructure. This is a manifestation of Conway's law [@Conway-committees68], which suggests that organizations which design systems are constrained to create systems which mirror the organization's own communication structure.}

* Modern AI paradox: misalignment of innovation with societal needs
* Innovation concentrated in commercial, not social domains
* Gap between technological advancement and social value creation

\notes{Modern AI systems present us with a new productivity paradox. It is less about absolute measures of productivity and more about the distribution of the benefits of productivity. Investments in AI are failing to map onto societal needs. Traditional market and policy mechanisms have proven to be inadequate for connecting the supply of innovation to societal demand.}

\notes{Public dialogues consistently show a desire for AI solutions in sectors such as healthcare, education, and social services, yet the innovation economy has prioritized areas such as creative content generation that the public explicitly suggested was a low priority. This persistent misalignment represents the new productivity paradox - where we have the technical capability but fail to direct it toward our most pressing societal needs.}
