\notes{One of the most significant features of the modern AI landscape is the extreme concentration of computing resources required for cutting-edge AI development. This concentration has profound implications for the structure of the AI ecosystem and for policy considerations.}

\notes{The scale of compute required for training state-of-the-art AI models has grown exponentially. According to some estimates, the compute used for the largest AI training runs has doubled approximately every 6-10 months since 2012, far outpacing Moore's Law. Training a model like GPT-4 likely required resources in the hundreds of millions of dollars.}

\notes{This creates a compute barrier that effectively limits who can participate in foundation model development to a small club of well-resourced organizations - primarily large technology companies and a handful of well-funded research labs. Even academic researchers at leading institutions often depend on partnerships with industry to access the necessary resources.}

\notes{The hardware that powers AI systems is similarly concentrated. NVIDIA has established a dominant position in the market for AI accelerators, with its GPUs being essential for most large-scale AI training. While competitors are emerging, the combination of specialized hardware and software ecosystems creates strong network effects that reinforce concentration.}

\notes{Cloud computing services add another layer of concentration, with AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure controlling much of the market for AI-oriented computing resources. For many organizations, these platforms represent the only viable way to access the hardware needed for AI development and deployment.}

\notes{This concentration creates several policy challenges. It raises competition concerns, as control over compute resources can translate into control over AI capabilities more broadly. It creates potential vulnerabilities in supply chains and infrastructure that may have national security implications. And it raises questions about equitable access to a technology that is increasingly seen as having broad societal importance.}

\notes{Policy responses to compute concentration might include public investment in research computing infrastructure, measures to ensure fair access to commercial computing resources, support for hardware diversification and open-source alternatives, and international cooperation to prevent destructive competition over compute resources.}
