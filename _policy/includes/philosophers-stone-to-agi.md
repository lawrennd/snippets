\subsection{From Philosopher's Stone to AGI}

\notes{The philosopher's stone was a mythical substance that could
convert base metals to gold. Before modern chemistry, alchemists like
Isaac Newton dedicated time to searching for this transformative
substance. Today, we recognize this as a misguided scientific foray,
much like perpetual motion machines or cold fusion.}

* Philosopher's stone: sought to transform base metals to gold
* Modern parallel: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* Both concepts promise magical transformation

\newslide{The AGI Misconception}

\notes{The term artificial general intelligence builds on the notion
of general intelligence that originated with Charles Spearman's work
in the early 20th century @Spearman-general04. Spearman's work was
part of a wider attempt to quantify intelligence in the same way we
quantify height - an approach connected to eugenics and Francis
Galton's book "Hereditary Genius" @Galton-hereditary69.}

\slidesincremental{
* AGI based on flawed notion of rankable intelligence
* Like an "artificial general vehicle" for all journeys
* Intelligence is context-specific, not universal

\notes{There are general principles underlying intelligence, but the
notion of a rankable form of intelligence where one entity dominates
all others is fundamentally flawed. Yet it is this notion that
underpins the modern idea of artificial general intelligence.}

\notes{To understand the flaws, consider the concept of an "artificial
general vehicle" - a vehicle that would dominate all other vehicles in
all circumstances, regardless of whether you're traveling from Nairobi
to Nyeri or just to the end of your road. While there are general
principles of transportation, the idea of a single vehicle that would
be optimal in all situations is absurd. Similarly, intelligence is
composed of various capabilities that are appropriate in different
contexts, not a single formula that dominates in all respects.}
