\subsection{From Philosopher's Stone to AGI}

\notes{The philosopher's stone was a mythical substance that could convert base metals to gold. Before modern chemistry, alchemists like Isaac Newton dedicated time to searching for this transformative substance. Today, we recognize this as a misguided scientific foray, much like perpetual motion machines or cold fusion.}

* Philosopher's stone: sought to transform base metals to gold
* Modern parallel: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* Both concepts promise magical transformation

\newslide{The AGI Misconception}

\notes{The term artificial general intelligence builds on the notion of general intelligence that originated with Charles Spearman's work in the early 20th century @Spearman-general04. Spearman's work was part of a wider attempt to quantify intelligence in the same way we quantify height - an approach connected to eugenics and Francis Galton's book "Hereditary Genius" @Galton-hereditary69.}

\slides{
* AGI based on flawed notion of rankable intelligence
* Like an "artificial general vehicle" for all journeys
* Intelligence is context-specific, not universal
}

\notes{There are general principles underlying intelligence, but the notion of a rankable form of intelligence where one entity dominates all others is fundamentally flawed. Yet it is this notion that underpins the modern idea of artificial general intelligence.}

\notes{To understand the flaws, consider the concept of an "artificial general vehicle" - a vehicle that would dominate all other vehicles in all circumstances, regardless of whether you're traveling from Nairobi to Nyeri or just to the end of your road. While there are general principles of transportation, the idea of a single vehicle that would be optimal in all situations is absurd. Similarly, intelligence is composed of various capabilities that are appropriate in different contexts, not a single formula that dominates in all respects.}
