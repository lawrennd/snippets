\subsection{AI Policy Challenges}

\notes{Despite significant advances in machine learning technologies,
artificial intelligence is failing to deliver in the areas of most
importance to citizens. Public dialogues conducted by the UK Royal
Society in 2017 revealed strong desires for AI to tackle challenges in
health, education, security, and social care while showing explicit
disinterest in AI-generated art @RoyalSociety-public17.}

* Public priorities: health, education, security, social care
* Current focus: creative content generation, commercial applications
* Result: innovation misalignment with societal needs
}

\newslide{The Implementation Gap}

\notes{Major IT project failures like the UK's Horizon program and the
NHS Lorenzo project demonstrate that the challenges aren't just
technical, but reflect a fundamental failure to bridge the gap between
underlying needs and provided solutions. These weren't just technical
failures, but failures of understanding. The Lorenzo project from the
UK NHS National Programme for IT was cancelled with a bill of over £10
billion @Justinia-npfit17.}

* UK Horizon program: wrongful prosecutions of subpostmasters
* NHS Lorenzo project: cancelled with £10+ billion bill
* Root cause: gap between technology and human needs
}

\notes{In digital technologies, traditional market mechanisms have
failed to map macro-level interventions to micro-level societal
needs. This creates a persistent gap between the supply of technical
solutions and the demands from society, a new productivity paradox
where the fruits of new technology are unevenly distributed.}

\notes{Without changing our approach to technology deployment, we risk
the same implementation problems with the widespread deployment of
AI. Conventional approaches to technology deployment continue to fall
short, and radical changes are needed to ensure that AI truly serves
citizens, science, and society.}
