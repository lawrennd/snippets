\subsection{AI Policy Challenges}

\notes{Despite significant advances in machine learning technologies, artificial intelligence is failing to deliver in the areas of most importance to citizens. Public dialogues conducted by the UK Royal Society in 2017 revealed strong desires for AI to tackle challenges in health, education, security, and social care while showing explicit disinterest in AI-generated art @RoyalSociety-public17.}

\slides{
* Public priorities: health, education, security, social care
* Current focus: creative content generation, commercial applications
* Result: innovation misalignment with societal needs

\newslide{The Implementation Gap}

\notes{Major IT project failures like the UK's Horizon program and the NHS Lorenzo project demonstrate that the challenges aren't just technical, but reflect a fundamental failure to bridge the gap between underlying needs and provided solutions. These weren't just technical failures, but failures of understanding. The Lorenzo project from the UK NHS National Programme for IT was cancelled with a bill of over £10 billion @Justinia-npfit17.}

\slides{
* UK Horizon program: wrongful prosecutions of subpostmasters
* NHS Lorenzo project: cancelled with £10+ billion bill
* Root cause: gap between technology and human needs
}

\notes{In digital technologies, traditional market mechanisms have failed to map macro-level interventions to micro-level societal needs. This creates a persistent gap between the supply of technical solutions and the demands from society, a new productivity paradox where the fruits of new technology are unevenly distributed.}

\notes{Without changing our approach to technology deployment, we risk the same implementation problems with the widespread deployment of AI. Conventional approaches to technology deployment continue to fall short, and radical changes are needed to ensure that AI truly serves citizens, science, and society.}
