\notes{The AI value chain encompasses the full spectrum of activities and resources required to create, deploy, and derive value from artificial intelligence systems. Unlike traditional industrial value chains, the AI value chain is characterized by strong feedback loops, network effects, and concentrated power at key points.}

\notes{At the foundation of this chain lies compute infrastructure - the specialized hardware, data centers, and cloud services needed to train and run AI models. This layer is heavily concentrated, with a few chip manufacturers (like NVIDIA) and cloud providers (like AWS, Google, and Microsoft) controlling access to critical resources.}

\notes{The next layer involves data - both the massive datasets used to train foundation models and the specialized data needed for particular applications. Here again we see concentration, as large technology companies have advantages in data access and the resources to process it.}

\notes{The model development layer has been transformed by foundation models - large general-purpose AI systems that serve as the basis for numerous applications. The immense resources required to develop these models create natural oligopolies, with only a handful of organizations capable of training state-of-the-art systems.}

\notes{At the application layer, we see both concentration and fragmentation. Major platforms integrate AI into their existing products, leveraging their user base and data advantages. Meanwhile, a broader ecosystem of startups and developers builds specialized applications on top of foundation models.}

\notes{Finally, at the end-user layer, we see the actual deployment and use of AI systems across different sectors and contexts. Here, the value chain connects to broader economic and social systems, with effects on labor markets, social interactions, and public discourse.}

\notes{For policymakers, understanding this value chain reveals several important insights. First, it highlights the critical concentration points where intervention might be most effective. Second, it shows how technical choices at one layer propagate through the system to affect societal outcomes. And third, it helps identify where market incentives may not align with public interest, necessitating policy action.}
