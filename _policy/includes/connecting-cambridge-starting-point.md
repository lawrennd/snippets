\subsection{Why Connecting Cambridge?}

\notes{The attention reinvestment cycle requires breaking down traditional silos. Universities are often organized in ways that make interdisciplinary collaboration difficult - different departments, different funding streams, different cultures of research. Yet the problems society faces don't respect these boundaries.}

\slides{
* Universities organised in silos
* Real problems don't respect boundaries
* Need to connect expertise across disciplines

\newslide{Cambridge's Unique Position}

\notes{Cambridge has extraordinary depth and breadth of expertise - from fundamental AI research to education, healthcare, policy, and ethics. But this expertise is distributed across over 100 departments and 31 colleges. The challenge isn't a lack of capability - it's connecting that capability to address real needs.}

\slides{
* Extraordinary breadth: 100+ departments, 31 colleges
* Deep expertise across AI, education, health, policy, ethics
* Challenge: connecting capability to needs

\newslide{Two Complementary Initiatives}

\notes{This is where ai@cam and Accelerate Science come together as complementary initiatives. ai@cam is the University's flagship mission, working across all six schools to ensure AI development serves science, citizens, and society. It creates the institutional frameworks, convenes diverse stakeholders, and builds the bridges between research, policy, and practice.}

\notes{Accelerate Science focuses specifically on the research frontier - helping scientists across disciplines use AI and machine learning to tackle their research challenges. It operates as a knowledge network, sharing expertise, tools, and best practices across research groups.}

\slides{
* **ai@cam**: University-wide mission across 6 schools
* **Accelerate Science**: Science supporting-focused programme
* Complementary approaches to connecting expertise

\newslide{From Connection to Impact}

\notes{Together, these initiatives demonstrate how the attention reinvestment cycle can work in practice. By connecting researchers across Cambridge, we create networks where freed attention - whether from better tools, shared infrastructure, or collective learning - gets reinvested in building capacity across the system. This isn't about a single breakthrough; it's about building an ecosystem where innovation serves real needs.}

\slides{
* Connect researchers across boundaries
* Share tools, infrastructure, knowledge
* Build capacity across the ecosystem
}

\notes{This model of "connecting Cambridge" becomes a starting point because it demonstrates that before we can deploy AI to solve societal problems, we need to connect the people who understand those problems with the people developing AI tools. The attention reinvestment cycle requires these human networks as much as it requires technical infrastructure.}
